Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
synchronization on the Web platform.
It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
expose its features through declarative means.
In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
for scripting.

<h3 id="use-cases">Use cases</h3>

The Web Animations model aims at two broad areas of application:

:   User interface effects
::  Animation can be used to give visual clues and feedback to make
    a user interface more readily comprehensible.

    For example, a user action results in a table row being
    removed to represent an item being removed from a shopping cart.cd -
    In such a case, fading the row to transparent and then shifting
    the subsequent rows up to fill the space over a few hundred
    milliseconds provides the user with clear feedback as to the
    results of their action as opposed to instantly removing the row
    from the DOM.

    To support this scenario not only are the animated effects of
    fading and shifting required, but so is synchronization, both
    between the animations, and between animations and scripted
    actions (removing the table row from the DOM after the animations
    have completed).

:   Storytelling and visualization
::  Another type of animation uses the animated effect to convey
    a story or represent some information.
    Unlike user interface effects which are largely a presentational
    adjunct to the content, these animations form an essential part of
    the content presented to the user.

    For example, in an animated cartoon two cats fly through space
    to another planet leaving a rainbow trail behind them.
    After arriving at the planet a change of scene occurs and the user
    should decide whether or not the cats enter a magic mountain by
    selecting one of two preset destinations in the scene.

    This scenario requires the following features:

    *   animated effects for moving characters along a path as well as
        warping a path (the rainbow trail),
    *   synchronization that allows some actions to happen
        simultaneously (the two cats moving) and others in sequence
        (the change of scene),
    *   play control to allow rewinding the cartoon, or changing its
        playback rate to accommodate particular learning or
        accessibility needs,
    *   the ability to trigger animations in response to user input

    Similar use cases in this category include visualising physical
    phenomena such as spring motion for educational purposes,
    or visualising data such as the prevalence of a disease over
    a geographical space over a year whereby animation is used to
    present the time-based component of the data.

<h3 id="relationship-to-other-specifications">Relationship to other specifications</h3>

CSS Transitions [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-CSS3-TRANSITIONS">CSS3-TRANSITIONS</a></cite>], CSS Animations
[<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-CSS3-ANIMATIONS">CSS3-ANIMATIONS</a></cite>], and SVG [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SVG112">SVG112</a></cite>] all provide mechanisms \
that
generate animated content on a Web page.
Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
they are described in different terms.
This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
without any observable change.

The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
Animation [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SMIL-ANIMATION">SMIL-ANIMATION</a></cite>].
It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
Animation can be removed.

As with Timing control for script-based animations (commonly referred
to as &ldquo;requestAnimationFrame&rdquo;) [[ANIMATION-TIMING]],
the programming interface component of this specification allows
animations to be created from script.
The animations created using the interface defined in this
specification, however, once created, are executed entirely by the
user agent meaning they share the same performance characteristics as
animations defined by markup.
Using this interface it is possible to create animations
from script in a simpler and more performant manner.

The time values used within the programming interface
correspond with those used in Timing control for script-based
animations [[ANIMATION-TIMING]] and their execution order to defined
such that the two interfaces can be used simultaneously without conflict.

The programming interface component of this specification makes
some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-HTML5">HTML5</a></cite>].

<h3 id="overview-of this-specification">Overview of this specification</h3>

This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
abstract model.
The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:

:   Timing model
::  Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
    within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
    fraction</em>.
    An <em>iteration index</em> is also generated for animations
    that vary as they repeat.
:   Animation model
::  Takes the <em>time fractions</em> and <em>iteration indices</em>
    produced by the timing model and converts them into a series of values
    to apply to the target properties and attributes.

Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600" alt="Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
fraction and an iteration index.<br>
These parameters are used as input to the animation model which produces
the values to apply.<br>
</p>

For example, consider an animation that:

*   starts after 3 seconds
*   runs twice,
*   takes 2 seconds every time, and
*   changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.

The first three points apply to the timing model.
At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width

This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
the animation model.

</div>

<h2 id="timing-model">Timing model</h2>

This section describes and defines the behavior of the Web Animations
timing model.

<h3 id="the-timing-model-at-a-glance">The timing model at a glance</h3>

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
<em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.

<h4 id="stateless">Stateless</h4>

The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
producing an output time fraction.
Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
This gives the model the following properties:


:   Frame-rate independent
::  Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
    which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
    Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
    real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
    regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
:   Direction-agnostic
::  Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
    directionless.
    This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
    a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
    handling.
:   Constant-time seeking
::  Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
    processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
    future, is at least potentially constant.

There are a few exceptions to the stateless behavior of the timing
model.

Firstly, a number of methods defined in the <a
href="#programming-interface" section>programming interface</a> to the model
provide play control such as pausing an animation.
These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
called and are therefore stative.
These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
of the core timing model but are layered on top.

Similarly, the <a href="#reaching-the-end" section>finishing behavior</a> of
players means that dynamic changes to the end time of
the media (source content) of a player may produce a different result
depending on when the change occurs.
This behavior is somewhat unfortunate but has been deemed intuitive
and consistent with HTML.
As a result, the model can only truly be described as stateless
<em>in the absence of dynamic changes to its timing properties</em>.

Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
establish a temporary state.
While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
href="#programming-interface" section>programming interface</a>, it has no
influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
the stateless qualities described above.

<h4 id="hierarchical">Hierarchical</h4>

The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
that time is inherited.
Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
down a number of steps to each animation.
At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
reversed, paused, and repeated.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/time-hierarchy.svg" width="600"
            alt="A hierarchy of timing nodes">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  A hierarchy of timing nodes.
  Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.
  At the root of the tree is the global clock.
</p>

A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
on as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent
cascade down to its <a>descendants</a>.
Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
animations.

</div>

<h3 id="timing-model-concepts">Timing model concepts</h3>

In Web Animations, timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
between timing nodes.
Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
of <a>time values</a>.
A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
a number of milliseconds from some moment.
The connection between <a>time values</a> and wall-clock milliseconds
may be obscured by any number of transformations applied to the value as
it passes through the time hierarchy.

<p class="annotation">
In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
which case the connection between time values and milliseconds will be
weakened even further.
</p>

A <a>time value</a> may also be <dfn>unresolved</dfn> if, for example,
a timing node is not in a state to produce a <a>time value</a>.

Periodically, the user agent will queue a task to update the timing
model in a process called <dfn>sampling</dfn>.
On each <dfn title='single-sample'>sample</dfn> the 
<a>time values</a> of each timing node are updated.

Note: A more precise definition of when the model is updated when scripting is
    involved is provided in <a
    href="#script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model"
    section></a>.

<h3 id="the-global-clock">The global clock</h3>

At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
clock</a>.

The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing
<a>time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the system clock.
The <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global clock</a> represent
wall-clock milliseconds from an unspecified historical moment.
Because the zero time of the <a>global clock</a> is not specified,
the absolute values of the <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global
clock</a> are not significant, only their rate of change.

Note: The <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
    href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
    expected to be exposed by markup.
    As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a>time values</a>
    are measured, that is, the zero time of the clock, is
    implementation-dependent.
    One user agent may measure the number of milliseconds since the the user
    agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
    started.
    Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
    in the output of the model.


<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>

A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a>time values</a> for the
purpose of synchronization.

Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
the <a>global clock</a>.
This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
<dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
<a>global clock</a> at that moment.
At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.

<p class="annotation">
  Note that we anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
  in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
  For example, a timeline whose time values are related to the progress of
  a UI gesture.
</p>

Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined relative to a moment that has yet
to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
value</a>, but only an <a>unresolved</a> time value.
A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be
<dfn title="inactive timeline">inactive</dfn>
when its <a>time value</a> is <a>unresolved</a>.

<h4 id="the-document-timeline">The document timeline</h4>

Each document has a <a>timeline</a> called the <dfn>document
timeline</dfn>.
The <a>time values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> are calculated
as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that the <a>zero
time</a> corresponds to the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-navigationstart">
<code>navigationStart</code></a> moment [[!NAVIGATION-TIMING]].
Prior to this moment, the <a>document timeline</a> is
<a title="inactive timeline">inactive</a>.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Since the <a>document timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global
clock</a> by a fixed offset, <a>time values</a> reported by the
<a>document timeline</a> increase monotonically.
Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a>time values</a>
are proportional to wall-clock milliseconds.

Since the <a>time values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> are
relative to the <code>navigationStart</code> time,
<code>document.timeline.currentTime</code> will roughly correspond to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/#dom-performance-now">
<code>Performance.now()</code></a>
[[HR-TIME]] with the exception that
<code>document.timeline.currentTime</code> does not change within
a script execution block as defined in <a
href="#script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model" section></a>.

</div>

<h3 id="players">Players</h3>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>players</em>.
A player takes an <a>animation node</a> which is a static
description of some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a>
so that it runs.
A player also allows run-time control of the connection between the
<a>animation node</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
seeking, and speed control.
The relationship between a player and an <a>animation node</a> is
analogous to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
</div>

A <dfn>player</dfn> connects a single <a>animation node</a>, called
its <dfn>source content</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and provides
playback control.
Both of these associations are optional and configurable such that
a <a>player</a> may have no associated <a>source content</a> or
<a>timeline</a> at a given moment.

A <a>player</a>'s <dfn title="player start time">start time</dfn> is the
<a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a> when its <a>source content</a>
is scheduled to begin playback. A players's <a
title="player start time">start time</a> is initially
<a>unresolved</a>.

A <a>player</a> also maintains a <dfn>hold time</dfn> <a>time value</a>
which is used to fix the player's output <a>time value</a>, called its
<a>current time</a>, in circumstances such as pausing</a>.
The <a>hold time</a> is initially <a>unresolved</a>.

When a <a>player</a> is created, it is assigned a globally unique
sequence number called the <dfn>player sequence number</dfn>.
This number is used to resolve the sort order of players for a variety
of situations such as combining animations and returning the list of
current players.

Issue: Should this actually be based on when the player is attached to
    a timeline? Or when it leaves the idle state?

<h4 id="setting-the-timeline">Setting the timeline of a player</h4>

The procedure to <dfn>set the timeline of a player</dfn>, <var>player</var>,
to <var>new timeline</var> which may be null, is as follows:

1.  Let <var>old timeline</var> be the current <a>timeline</a> of
    <var>player</var>, if any.
2.  If <var>new timeline</var> is the same object as <var>old timeline</var>,
    abort this procedure.
3.  If <var>new timeline</var> is null and <var>old timeline</var> is not null,
    run the procedure to <a>reset a player's pending tasks</a> on
    <var>player</var>.
    <p class="note">
      Note that if <var>new timeline</var> is not null and <var>player</var> has
      a <a>pending play task</a> or a <a>pending pause task</a> no special
      handling is required: the pending task will run as soon as the <a>source
      content</a> is <a>ready</a> even though this may occur at a different
      moment that it might have with the old timeline.

6.  Let the <a>timeline</a> of <var>player</var> be <var>new timeline</var>.
7.  <p class="todo">
      If <var>new timeline</var> is null, ensure that <a>custom effects</a> get
      called with an <a>unresolved</a> <a>time fraction</a> (unless a subsequent

    </p>
8.  Run the procedure to <a>update a player's finished state</a> for
    <var>player</var>.

The procedure to <dfn>reset a player's pending tasks</dfn> for <var>player</var>
is as follows:

1.  If <var>player</var> has a <a>pending play task</a>, cancel that task.
2.  If <var>player</var> has a <a>pending pause task</a>, cancel that task.
3.  Reject <var>player</var>'s <a>current ready promise</a> with a DOMException
    named "AbortError".
4.  Let <var>player</var>'s <a>current ready promise</a> be a new resolved
    Promise object.

<h4 id="setting-the-source-content">Setting the source content of a

The procedure to <dfn>set the source content of a player</dfn>,
<var>player</var>, to <var>new content</var> which may be null, is as follows:

    <var>player</var>, if any.
2.  If <var>new content</var> is the same object as <var>old content</var>,
    abort this procedure.
3.  If <var>new content</var> is null and <var>old content</var> is not null,

<h4 id="the-current-time-of-a-player">The current time of a player</h4>

<a>Players</a> provide a <a>time value</a> to their <a>source
content</a> called the player's <dfn>current time</dfn>.

The <a>current time</a> is calculated from the first
matching condition from below:

<div class="switch">

:   If the player's <a>hold time</a> is <a title="unresolved">resolved</a>,

    1.  the player has no associated <a>timeline</a>, or
    2.  the associated <a>timeline</a> is
        <a title='inactive timeline'>inactive</a>, or
    3.  the player's <a title="player start time">start time</a> is

The <a>current time</a> of a player can be set to a new value to

The procedure for setting the current time is split into two parts.

The procedure to <dfn>silently set the current time</dfn> of
a player, <var>player</var>, to <var>seek time</var> is as follows:

1.  If <var>seek time</var> is an <a>unresolved</a> time value, or is

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Some operations performed by a <a>player</a> may not occur
instantaneously.
For example, some user agents may delegate the playback of an
animation to a separate process or to specialized graphics hardware
each of which may incur some setup overhead.

If such an animation is timed from the moment when the animation was
triggered there may be a significant jump between the first and second
frames of the animation corresponding to the setup time involved.

To avoid this problem, Web Animations typically begins timing
animations from the moment when the first frame of the animation is
complete.
This is represented by an <a>unresolved</a> <a
title="player start time">start time</a> on the <a>player</a> which becomes
resolved when the animation is <a>ready</a>.
Content may opt out of this behavior by setting the <a
title="player start time">start time</a>
to a <a title="unresolved">resolved</a> <a>time value</a>.

</div>

A player's <a>source content</a> is <dfn>ready</dfn> when the user
agent has completed any setup required to begin the playback of each
<a>inclusive descendant</a> of the <a>source content</a> including
rendering the first frame of any <a>animation</a> with an associated
<a>animation effect</a> or executing any <a>custom
effects</a> associated with such an <a>animation</a>.

<h4 id='the-current-ready-promise'>The current ready promise</h4>

Each <a>player</a> has a <dfn>current ready promise</dfn>.
The <a>current ready promise</a> is initially a resolved Promise
object.

The object is replaced with a new Promise object every time the player
enters the <a>pending play state</a> as well as when the player is
cancelled (see <a href="#cancelling-a-player-section" section></a>).

<div class="note">

    Note that since the same object is used for both pending play and
    pending pause requests, authors are advised to check the state of the
    player when the Promise is resolved.

    For example, in the following code fragment, the state of the player
    will be <a title="running play state">running</a> when the
    <a>current ready promise</a> is resolved.
    This is because the player does not leave the <a>pending play state</a>
    in between the calls to <code>pause</code> and
    <code>play</code> and hence the <a>current ready promise</a> does
    not change.

    <pre class='example sh_javascript'>
        player.pause();
        player.ready.then(function() {
          // Displays 'running'
          alert(player.playState);

    and abort these steps.
2.  Let <var>has pending ready promise</var> be a boolean flag that is
    initially false.
3.  If <var>player</var> has a <a>pending play task</a>,

    1.  Cancel that task.
    2.  Set <var>has pending ready promise</var> to true.

4.  If <var>player</var> has a <a>pending pause task</a>,

    1.  Cancel that task.
    2.  Restore the value of <var>player</var>'s

    3.  Set <var>has pending ready promise</var> to true.

4.  Perform the steps corresponding to the <em>first</em> matching

5.  If <var>has pending ready promise</var> is false,
    let <var>player</var>'s <a>current ready promise</a> be a new
    pending Promise object.

5.  Schedule a task to run as soon as <var>player</var>'s <a>source
    content</a> is <a>ready</a>.
    The task shall perform the following steps:

    1.  Let <var>ready time</var> be the <a>time value</a> of
        the <a>timeline</a> associated with <var>player</var> at the moment
        when <var>player</var>'s <a>source content</a> became <a>ready</a>.

    9.  Run the procedure to <a>update a player's finished state</a>

<h4 id='pausing-a-player-section'>Pausing a player</h4>

Players maintain a boolean <dfn>pause flag</dfn> to indicate a player
whose current time is suspended.
The <a>pause flag</a> is initially false.

As with <a title="play a player">playing a player</a>, pausing may not happen
instantaneously (see <a href="#waiting-for-source-content" section></a>).
For example, if animation is performed by a separate process, it may
be necessary to synchronize the <a>current time</a> to ensure that it
reflects the state drawn by the animation process.

For this reason, the procedure to <a>pause a player</a> makes the
player's <a>current time</a> <a>unresolved</a> until the pause
operation is complete.

The procedure to <dfn>pause a player</dfn>, <var>player</var> is as follows:

1.  If there is no <a>timeline</a> associated with <var>player</var>, or the
    associated <a>timeline</a> is <a title="inactive timeline">inactive</a>

2.  If <var>player</var>'s <a>pause flag</a> is true or if <var>player</var>
    has a <a>pending pause task</a>, abort these steps.
3.  Let <var>has pending ready promise</vaR> be a boolean flag that is
    initially false.
4.  If <var>player</var> has a <a>pending play task</a>, cancel that task
    and let <var>has pending ready promise</var> be true.
5.  Set <var>player</var>'s <a>pause flag</a> to true.
6.  Make <var>player</var>'s <a title="player start time">start time</a>
    <a>unresolved</a>.
7.  Make <var>player</var>'s <a>hold time</a> <a>unresolved</a>.
8.  If <var>has pending ready promise</var> is false,
    set <var>player</var>'s <a>current ready promise</a> to a new
    pending Promise object.
9.  Schedule a task to be executed at the first possible moment after
    the user agent has performed any processing necessary to suspend
    the playback of any animations that are <a>inclusive
    descendants</a> of <var>player</var>'s <a>source content</a>, if any.
    The task shall perform the following steps:

    1.  Set <var>player</var>'s <a>hold time</a> to the <a>time value</a>
        corresponding to the value of <var>player</var>'s <a>current time</a>
        used at the moment when the pause operation was completed,
        even if that value was <a>unresolved</a>.

        Note: since <var>player</var>'s
            <a title="player start time">start time</a> and
            <a>hold time</a> are set to <a>unresolved</a> earlier in this
            procedure, user agents will be required to maintain
            additional state in order to determine the appropriate
            value of the <a>current time</a>.

    2.

        <div class="todo">Queue a task here for sampling custom effects
            with the final current time.  (This should happen before we

<h4 id="reaching-the-end">Reaching the end</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Players in the real world such as DVD players or cassette players
typically continue playing until they reach the end of their media
at which point they stop.
If such players are able to play in reverse, they typically stop
playing when they reach the beginning of their media.
In order to emulate this behavior and to provide consistency
with HTML's <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements">media
elements</a> [[HTML5]], the <a>current time</a> of Web Animations'
players do not play forwards beyond the <a>end time</a> of their
<a>source content</a> or play backwards past time zero.

A player that has reached the natural boundary of its playback range
is said to have <em>finished</em>.

Graphically, the effect of limiting the current time is shown below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/limiting.svg" width="500"
       alt="The effect of limiting the current time of a player.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
The effect of limiting the <a>current time</a> of a <a>player</a>
with a start time of 1s, a source content of length 3s, and
a positive <a>player playback rate</a>.
After the <a>current time</a> of the player reaches the end of the
source content, it is capped at 3s.
</p>

It is possible, however, to <em>seek</em> the <a>current time</a> of
a <a>player</a> to a time past the end of the <a>source content</a>.
When doing so, the <a>current time</a> will not progress but the
player will act as if it had been paused at the seeked time.

This allows, for example, seeking the <a>current time</a> of
a player with <em>no</em> <a>source content</a> to 5s.
If <a>source content</a> with an <a>end time</a> later than 5s is
later associated with the player, playback will begin from the 5s
mark.

Similar behavior to the above scenario may arise when the
length of a player's <a>source content</a> changes.

Similarly, when the <a>player playback rate</a> is negative, the
<a>current time</a> does not progress past time zero.

</div>

<h4 id="the-current-finished-promise">The current finished promise</h4>

Each player has a <dfn>current finished promise</dfn>.
The <a>current finished promise</a> is initially a pending Promise
object.

The object is replaced with a new Promise object every time the player
leaves the <a>finished play state</a>.

<h4 id="updating-the-finished-state">Updating the finished state</h4>

For a player with a positive <a title="player playback rate">playback
rate</a>, the <a>current time</a> continues to increase until it
reaches the <a>source content end</a>.

The <dfn>source content end</dfn> of a player is equal to the <a>end
time</a> of the player's <a>source content</a>.
If the player has no <a>source content</a>, the <a>source content
end</a> is zero.

A player with a negative <a title="player playback rate">playback
rate</a>, the <a>current time</a> continues to decrease until it
reaches zero.

A player that has reached this boundary (or overshot it) and whose
<a>pause flag</a> is false is said to be <a
title="finished play state">finished</a>.

The crossing of this boundary is checked on each modification to the
player object using the procedure for <a>update a player's finished
state</a> defined below.

For each player, the user agent maintains a <dfn>previous current
time</dfn> <a>time value</a> that is originally <a>unresolved</a>,
and a <dfn>previous finished state</dfn> boolean flag that is
initially false.

<div class='todo'>
    Mention that this gets run at the end of each sample as well.
    And at the end of any update to the timing of the <a>source

</div>

The procedure to <dfn>update a player's finished state</dfn> for

<h4 id="finishing-a-player-section">Finishing a player</h4>

A player can be advanced to the natural end of its current playback
direction by using the procedure to <dfn>finish a player</dfn>
for <var>player</var> defined below:


1.  If <a>player playback rate</a> is zero,
    <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-throw">throw</a>
    an "<a

    :   If <a>player playback rate</a> &gt; 0,</dt>
    ::  Let <var>limit</var> be <a>source content end</a>.</dd>

    :   Otherwise,
    ::  Let <var>limit</var> be zero.</dd>

    </div>

3.  <a>Set the current time</a> to <var>limit</var>.

    <div class="annotation">
        The procedure for setting the current time has the side effect of

4.  If there is a <a>pending play task</a>, cancel that task and

    <var>player</var>.

5.  If <var>player</var> has an associated <a>timeline</a> that is

    where <var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time value</a>
    of the associated <a>timeline</a>.

6.  Run the procedure to <a>update a player's finished state</a>
    for <var>player</var>.

Note: Finishing a player does not necessarily cause that player
to enter the <a>finished play state</a>. In particular, if a player was in the
<a>paused play state</a> before finishing, it will remain in the
<a>paused play state</a> afterwards.

<h4 id='cancelling-a-player-section'>Cancelling a player</h4>

 A player can be cancelled which causes the <a>current time</a> to
become <a>unresolved</a> hence removing any effects caused by the
<a>source content</a>.

The procedure to <dfn>cancel a player</dfn> for <var>player</var> is
as follows:

1.  Run the procedure to <a>reset a player's pending tasks</a> on
    <var>player</var>.
2.  Reject the <a>current finished promise</a> with a DOMException
      named "AbortError".
3.  Let <a>current finished promise</a> be a new pending Promise

4.  Make <var>player</var>'s <a>hold time</a> <a>unresolved</a>.
5.  Make <var>player</var>'s <a title="player start time">start time</a>

6.  Set <var>player</var>'s <a>pause flag</a> to false.
7.  Queue a task to call any <a>custom effects</a> associated with

    <p class="issue">

    </p>

<h4 id="speed-control">Speed control</h4>

<div class="informative-bg">

The rate of play of a player can be controlled by setting its
<em>playback rate</em>.
For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the player's
<a>current time</a> to increase at twice the rate of its <a>timeline</a>.
Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the player's <a>current
time</a> to decrease at the same rate as the <a>time values</a> from
its <a>timeline</a> increase.

Note that <a>animation nodes</a> also have a <a
title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a> associated
with them that behaves differently to that defined here.

</div>

<a>Players</a> have a <dfn title="player playback
rate">playback rate</dfn> that provides a scaling factor from the rate
of change of the associated <a>timeline</a>'s <a>time values</a> to
the player's <a>current time</a>.
The <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.

Setting a player's <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
to zero effectively pauses the player b(however, the <a>play state</a>
does not necessarily become <a title="paused play state">paused</a>).

<h5 id="updating-the-playback-rate-of-a-player">
Updating the playback rate of a player</h5>

Changes to the <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>
trigger a compensatory seek so that that the player's
<a>current time</a> is unaffected by the change to the playback
rate.

The procedure to <dfn>update the player playback rate</dfn> of
a <a>player</a>, <var>player</var> to <var>new playback rate</var>
is as followsL

1.  Let <var>previous time</var> be the value of the
    <a>current time</a> of <var>player</var> before changing the
    <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a>.
2.  Set the <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> to
    <var>new playback rate</var>.
3.  If <var>previous time</var> is <a title="unresolved">resolved</a>,
    <a>set the current time</a> of <var>player</var> to
    <var>previous time</var>.

The procedure to <dfn>silently update the player playback rate</dfn>
of <a>player</a>, <var>player</var> to<var>new playback rate</var>
is identical to the above procedure except that rather than invoking

<h3 id="animation-nodes">Animation nodes</h3>

An <dfn>animation node</dfn> is an abstract term referring to an item in
the timing hierarchy.

<h4 id="animation-nodes-and-players">Relationship between animation nodes and players</h4>

The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, if set, is a type of
<a>animation node</a>.
The <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a> is said to be <dfn
title="directly associated with a player">directly associated</dfn>
with that player.

<a>Animation nodes</a> can be combined together into a hierarchy using
<a>animation groups</a> (see <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization"
section></a>).
Only the <a>root</a> <a>animation node</a> of such a hierarchy can be
<a>directly associated with a player</a>.
If an <a>animation node</a> that has a <a>parent animation group</a>
is designated as the <a>source content</a> of a <a>player</a>, the
<a>animation node</a> is removed from its <a>parent animation
group</a> before being associated with the <a>player</a>.

An <a>animation node</a> is <dfn>associated with a player</dfn> if it
is <a>directly associated with a player</a> or if it has an
<a>ancestor</a> <a>animation group</a> that is <a>directly associated
with a player</a>.
At a given moment, an <a>animation node</a> can be <a
title="associated with a player">associated</a> with at most one
<a>player</a>.

An <a>animation node</a>, <var>node</var>, is <dfn>associated with
a timeline</dfn>, <var>timeline</var>, if <var>node</var> is
<a>associated with a player</a> which, in turn, is associated with
<var>timeline</var>.

<h4 id="types-of-animation-nodes">Types of animation nodes</h4>

This specification defines two types of <a>animation nodes</a>:

* <a>animations</a>, and
* <a>animation groups</a>.

All types of <a>animation nodes</a> define a number of common
properties which are described in the following sections.

<h4 id="the-active-interval">The active interval</h4>

<div class="informative-bg">

The period that an <a>animation node</a> is scheduled to run is
called its <a>active interval</a>.
Each <a>animation node</a> has only one such interval.

The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is determined by the
<a title="animation node start time">start time</a> of the
<a>animation node</a> but may be shifted by a <a>start delay</a> on
the <a>animation node</a>.

The upper bound of the interval is determined by the <a>active
duration</a>.

The relationship between the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a>, <a>start
delay</a>, and <a>active duration</a> is illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/active-interval-examples.svg" width="600"
    alt="Examples of the effect of the start delay on the endpoints
        of the active interval">
</div>
<p class="caption">
Examples of the effect of the <a>start delay</a> on the endpoints of
the <a>active interval</a>.<br>
(a) An animation node with no delay; the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a> and beginning of
the <a>active interval</a> are coincident.<br>
(b) An animation node with a positive delay; the beginning of the
<a>active interval</a> is deferred by the delay.<br>
(c) An animation node with a negative delay; the beginning of the
<a>active interval</a> is brought forward by the delay.
</p>

An <a>end delay</a> may also be specified but is primarily only of
use when sequencing animations such as by using an
<a>animation sequence</a>.

</div>

<a>Animation nodes</a> define an <dfn>active interval</dfn> which is
the period of time during which the node is scheduled to produce its
effect with the exception of <a>fill modes</a> which apply outside the
<a>active interval</a>.

The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> is defined by the
combination of the animation node's
<a title="animation node start time">start time</a> and <a>start delay</a>.

An <a>animation node</a>'s
<dfn title="animation node start time">start time</dfn> is the moment at
which the <a>parent animation group</a>,
if any, has scheduled the <a>animation node</a> to begin.
It is expressed in <a>inherited time</a>.
In most cases, including the case when the <a>animation node</a> has
no <a>parent animation group</a>,
the <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> is zero.
The singular exception is <a>animation sequence</a> which set
the <a title="animation node start time">start times</a> of their
children as described in <a
href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-an-animation-sequence" section></a>.

In addition to the <a title="animation node start time">start
time</a>, an <a>animation node</a> also has a <dfn>start delay</dfn>
which is an offset from the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a>.
Unlike the <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> which
is determined by the <a>parent animation group</a>, the <a>start
delay</a> is a property of the <a>animation node</a> itself.

The lower bound of the <a>active interval</a> of an <a>animation
node</a>, expressed in <a title="inherited time">inherited time
space</a>, is the sum of the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a> and the <a>start
delay</a>.

These definitions are incorporated in the calculation of the <a>local
time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" section></a>)
and <a>active time</a>.

The length of the <a>active interval</a> is called the <dfn>active
duration</dfn>, the calculation of which is defined in <a
href="#calculating-the-active-duration" section></a>.

Similar to the <a>start delay</a>, an <a>animation node</a> also has
an <dfn>end delay</dfn> which may be used to delay the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a> of the <a>next
sibling</a> in a <a>animation sequence</a>.

<h4 id="local-time-and-inherited-time">Local time and inherited time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg">

In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
These different points of reference produce different <em>time
spaces</em>.

This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
graphics.
The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
a coordinate space.

Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
<a>Animation groups</a> typically perform some
transformations on the <a>time values</a> they
receive from their <a title="parent animation group">parent</a> or
<a>player</a> before passing on the transformed <a>time values</a>
to their children.
Child <a>animation nodes</a> then operate <em>within</em> that
transformed time space.

Children take the transformed time values from their
parent&mdash;called the <a>inherited time</a>&mdash;and add their
<a title="animation node start time">start time</a> to establish
their own <a title="local time">local time space</a> as illustrated
below.

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">
Inherited time and local time.<br>
At time <var>t</var>, the <a>inherited time</a> is 2.5.<br>
For <a>animation node</a> (a) which has a <a

  <a>local time</a> is 1.5.<br>
For <a>animation node</a> (b) which has a <a

  the <a>local time</a> is also 1.5
  since <a>local time</a> is based on an <a>animation node</a>'s
  <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> only,
  and not on its <a>start delay</a>.
</p>

</div>

For an <a>animation node</a>, the <dfn>inherited time</dfn> at
a given moment is based on the first matching condition from the
following:

<div class='switch'>

:   If the <a>animation node</a> has a <a>parent animation
    group</a>,
::  the inherited time is the <a>parent animation group</a>'s current
    <a>transformed time</a>.
:   If the <a>animation node</a> is directly associated with
    a <a>player</a>,
::  the inherited time is the <a>current time</a> of the
    <a>player</a>.
:   Otherwise,
::  the inherited time is <a>unresolved</a>.

</div>

The <dfn>local time</dfn> of an <a>animation node</a> is the
<a>animation node</a>'s <a>inherited time</a> minus its <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a>.
If the <a>inherited time</a> is <a>unresolved</a> then the local time
is also <a>unresolved</a>.

<h4 id="animation-node-phases-and-states">Animation node phases and states</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

At a given moment, an <a>animation node</a> may be in one of three
possible <em>phases</em>.
If an <a>animation node</a> has an <a>unresolved</a> <a>local
time</a> it will not be in any phase.

The different phases are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/animation-node-phases-and-states.svg" width="700"
    alt="An example of the different phases and states used to
         describe an animation node.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
An example of the different phases and states used to describe
an <a>animation node</a>.
</p>

The phases are as follows:

:   <a>before phase</a>
::  The <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls before the
    node's <a>active interval</a>.
:   <a>active phase</a>
::  The <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls inside the
    node's <a>active interval</a>.
:   <a>after phase</a>
::  The <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls after the
    node's <a>active interval</a>.

In addition to these phases, an <a>animation node</a> may also be
described as being in one of several overlapping <em>states</em>.
These states are only established for the duration of a single
sample and are primarily a convenience for describing stative parts
of the model.

These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
follows:

:   <a>in play</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation node</a> whose <a>active time</a>
    is changing on each sample.
    This occurs when the <a>animation node</a> <em>and all its
    ancestors</em> are in the <a>active phase</a>.
    <a>Animations</a> only &ldquo;move&rdquo; when they are
    <a>in play</a>.

    It is possible for an <a>animation node</a> to be in the
    <a>active phase</a> but not <a>in play</a>.
    For example, if an <a>animation node</a> has a <a>parent
    animation group</a> that causes the animation node's <a>active
    interval</a> to be clipped and both parent and child apply the
    same <a>fill mode</a>, the child <a>animation node</a> may be
    effectively be snapshotted within the <a>active phase</a>
    despite no longer being <a>in play</a>.

:   <a>current</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation node</a> that is either <a>in
    play</a> or may become <a>in play</a> in the future.
    This will be the case if the <a>animation node</a> is <a>in
    play</a> or in its <a>before phase</a>, <em>or</em> it has an
    ancestor for which this is true thereby opening up the
    possibility that this <a>animation node</a> might play again
    (e.g.  due to repeating).

    This state is used in the <a
    href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> to
    identify all <a>animations</a> and <a>players</a> that are
    likely to be of interest.

    Furthermore, the <a>current</a> state provides an important
    definition for managing the amount of memory required by
    implementations.
    Assuming a monotonically increasing <a>timeline</a> an
    implementation can safely discard all <a>animation nodes</a>
    that are <em>not</em> <a>current</a> and not referenced
    elsewhere provided they take care to preserve any fill values.
    This is because such <a>animation nodes</a> will no longer have
    any dynamic effect.

:   <a>in effect</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation node</a> that has a resolved
    <a>active time</a>.
    This occurs when either the <a>animation node</a> is in its
    <a>active phase</a> or outside the <a>active interval</a> but at
    a time where the node's <a>fill mode</a> (see <a
    href="#fill-behavior" section></a>) causes its
    <a>active time</a> to be resolved.
    Only <a>in effect</a> <a>animations</a> apply a result to
    their target.

The normative definition of each of these states follows.

</div>

An <a>animation node</a> is in the <dfn>before phase</dfn> if the
animation node's <a>local time</a> is not <a>unresolved</a> and is
less than the node's <a>start delay</a>.

An <a>animation node</a> is in the <dfn>active phase</dfn> if
<em>all</em> of the following conditions are met:

1.  the <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> is not
    <a>unresolved</a>, and
2.  the <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> is <em>greater than
    or equal</em> to its <a>start delay</a>, and
3.  the <a>animation node</a>'s <a>local time</a> is <em>less
    than</em> the sum of its <a>start delay</a> and <a>active
    duration</a>.

An <a>animation node</a> is in the <dfn>after phase</dfn> if the
animation node's <a>local time</a> is not <a>unresolved</a> and is
<em>greater than or equal</em> to the sum of its <a>start delay</a>
and <a>active duration</a>.

An <a>animation node</a> is <dfn>in play</dfn> if <em>all</em>
of the following conditions are met:

1.  the <a>animation node</a> is in the <a>active phase</a>, and
2.  the <a>animation node</a> has a <a>parent animation group</a> that
    is <a>in play</a> or else is <a>directly associated with
    a player</a> that is not <a title="finished play state">finished</a>.

An animation node is <dfn>current</dfn> if it <em>any</em> of the
following conditions is true:

*   it is in the <a>before phase</a>, or
*   it is <a>in play</a>, or
*   it has a <a>parent animation group</a> and the
    <a>parent animation group</a> is <a>current</a>.

An animation node is <dfn>in effect</dfn> if its <a>active time</a> as
calculated according to the procedure in <a
href="#calculating-the-active-time" section></a> is not
<a>unresolved</a>.

<h3 id="fill-behavior">Fill behavior</h3>

The effect of an <a>animation node</a> when it is not <a>in play</a> is
determined by its <dfn>fill mode</dfn>.

The possible <a>fill modes</a> are:

*   none,
*   forwards,
*   backwards, and
*   both.

The normative definition of these modes is incorporated in the
calculation of the <a>active time</a> in <a
href="#calculating-the-active-time" section></a>.

<h4 id="fill-modes">Fill modes</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The effect of each <a>fill mode</a> is as follows:

:   none
::  The animation node has no effect when it is not <a>in play</a>.
:   forwards</dt>
::  When the animation node is in the <a>after phase</a>,
    or when the animation node is in the <a>active phase</a> but an
    <a>ancestor</a> is in its <a>after phase</a>,
    the animation node will produce the same <a
    title="transformed time">transformed time value</a> as the last
    moment it is scheduled to be <a>in play</a>.

    For all other times that the animation node is not <a>in play</a>,
    it will have no effect.
:   backwards
::  When the animation node is in the <a>before phase</a>,
    or when the animation node is in the <a>active phase</a> but an
    <a>ancestor</a> is in its <a>before phase</a>,
    the animation node will produce the same <a
    title="transformed time">transformed time value</a> as the earliest
    moment that it is scheduled to be <a>in play</a>.

:   both</dt>
::  When the animation node or an <a>ancestor</a> is in its <a>before

    is used.

    When the animation node or an <a>ancestor</a> is in its <a>after
    phase</a>, <span class="prop-value">forwards</span> fill behavior is
    used.

Some examples of the these fill modes are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/animation-state-and-fill-behavior.svg" width="600"
    alt="Examples of various fill modes and the states produced.">

</p>

Note: setting a fill mode has no bearing on the endpoints of the
    <a>active interval</a>.
    However, the fill mode <em>does</em> have an effect on various other
    properties of the timing model since the <a>active time</a> of an
    animation node is only defined (that is, not <a>unresolved</a>) inside
    the <a>active interval</a> <em>or</em> when a fill is applied.

<div class="issue">
Currently <a>timing functions</a> that generate results outside the
range [0, 1] will behave unexpectedly when applied to animation
groups, as children will increase iterations or enter into fill mode
rather than continuing to extrapolate along their defined behavior
(which is what they would do if the timing function applied to them
directly).

To fix this it is possible we will wish to introduce 'overflow' fill
modes that respond to time values larger than or smaller than the
active time range by extrapolating rather than filling.

<h3 id="repeating">Repeating</h3>

<h4 id="iteration-intervals">Iteration intervals</h4>

It is possible to specify that an animation node should repeat
a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.

Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, an animation node can have multiple
<a>iteration intervals</a> although typically only the interval
corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.

The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
duration</dfn>.
The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of an animation node is simply
its <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.

The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of an animation node is
zero, however some specific types of animation node such as
<a>animation groups</a> override this behavior and provide an
alternative intrinsic duration (see <a
href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-group"
section></a> and <a
href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-sequence"
section></a>).

The <a>iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation node</a> may be set
by the author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic
iteration duration</a>.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the <a>active
duration</a> we have:

:   Iteration duration
::  The time taken for a single iteration of the animation node to
    complete.
:   Active duration
::  The time taken for the entire animation node to complete,
    including repetitions.
    This may be longer or shorter than the <a>iteration duration</a>.

The relationship between the <a>iteration duration</a> and <a>active
duration</a> is illustrated below.

  Note that the <a>iteration duration</a> for the final iteration does
  not change, it is simply cut-off by the <a>active duration</a>.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="controlling-iteration">Controlling iteration</h4>

The number of times an <a>animation node</a> repeats is called its
<dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
zero.
The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
that the <a>animation node</a> repeats indefinitely.

In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a>animation nodes</a> also
have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which specifies an offset
into the series of iterations at which the <a>animation node</a>
should begin.
The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
equal to zero.

The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a

<h4 id="iteration-time-space">Iteration time space</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
<a>local time</a> and <a>inherited time</a> (see <a
href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" section></a>).
Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
space.


<em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
beginning of an animation node's current iteration.


Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
interval.
This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
the programming interface or in markup.


These time spaces are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/time-spaces.svg" width="600"
    alt="A comparison of local time, active time, and iteration time.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
A comparison of local time, active time, and iteration time for an
animation with a iteration duration of 1s and an iteration count of
2.5.
</p>

Note: While the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
    Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
    time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
    diagram.
    For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
    <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
    <a>active time</a> defined in <a
    href="#calculating-the-active-time" section></a> will
    never return a negative value.

In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
<em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a>time
values</a> of the <a>document timeline</a> of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active
document</a>.

</div>

<h4 id="interval-timing">Interval timing</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

When an animation node repeats we must define the behavior at the
iteration boundaries.
For this and indeed for all interval-timing, Web Animations uses an
endpoint-exclusive timing model.
This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
In interval notation this can written <code>[begin, end)</code>.
This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.


In the examples below, for the repeated node, at local time 1s,
the iteration time is 0.
For the sequenced nodes, at inherited time 1s, only node B will be
<a>in play</a>; there is no overlap.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/endpoint-exclusive-timing.svg" width="600"

</div>
<p class="caption">
  Illustration of end-point exclusive timing. For both repeated and
  sequenced animation nodes there is no overlap at the boundaries
  between intervals.
</p>

An exception to this behavior is that when performing a <a
href="#fill-behavior">fill</a>, if the fill begins at an
interval endpoint, the endpoint is used.
This behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
href="#calculating-the-iteration-time"
section></a> and is illustrated below.

<h3 id="animation-node-speed-control">Animation node speed control</h3>

Like <a>players</a>, <a>animation nodes</a> also have a <dfn
title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
The <a title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a> of
an <a>animation node</a> is a finite real number that acts as
a multiplier when calculating the <a>animation node</a>'s <a>transformed
time</a> from its <a>local time</a>.

The effect of setting the <a title="animation node playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation node</a> differs from the
setting the <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on
a player.  Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in
<a href="#core-animation-node-calculations" section></a>.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In summary, the behavior of the <a title="animation node playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation node</a> is as follows:

*   The <a title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a> is
    applied only to the <a>active interval</a> of an <a>animation
    node</a> and not to the time while it is <a
    title="start delay">delayed</a> or <a title="fill mode">filling</a>.

*   Setting a negative <a title="animation node playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on an <a>animation node</a> causes the <a>animation
    node</a> to begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
    This differs from the <a title="player playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on a <a>player</a>.
    Setting a <a title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> on
    a <a>player</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
    <a>player</a>'s </a>source content</a> has begun, will result in the
    <a>source content</a> never playing.

*   Setting the <a title="animation node playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation node</a> affects the calculated value of
    the <a>active duration</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-active-duration"
    section></a>).

*   Changing the <a title="animation node playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation node</a> whose <a>local time</a> is
    within its <a>active interval</a> will cause it to jump.
    This is because the <a>active duration</a> will be updated but the
    <a>local time</a> will not.

    Furthermore, if other <a>animation nodes</a> depend on the
    <a>animation node</a>'s <a>active duration</a>, such as sibling
    <a>animation node</a> in a <a>animation sequence</a>, they
    too may jump as a result of setting the <a>animation node</a>'s <a
    title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a>.

    For runtime speed control the <a
    title="player playback rate">playback rate</a> of the
    <a>player</a> should be used.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
takes an <a>inherited time</a> value and converts it to an
<a>iteration time</a>.


Following this further transformations are applied before resulting at
a final <a>transformed time</a>.


The first step in this process is to calculate the bounds of the
<a>active interval</a> which is determined by the <a>active
duration</a>.

This process is illustrated below.

<h4 id="calculating-the-active-duration">Calculating the active duration</h4>

In order to calculate the <a>active duration</a> we first define the
<a>repeated duration</a> as follows:

<blockquote>
  <dfn>repeated duration</dfn> =
    <code><a>iteration duration</a> &times;
          <a>iteration count</a></code>
    <p>
      If either the <a>iteration duration</a> or <a>iteration count</a>

</blockquote>

The <a>active duration</a> is calculated according to the following
steps:

1.  If the <a title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a> is
      zero, return <code>Infinity</code>.
2.  Otherwise, return <code><a>repeated duration</a> / abs(<a
      title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a>)</code>.

However, it is only defined when the <a>animation node</a> should

phase as well as the phase of its <a>parent animation group</a>, if
any, as follows,

<h5 id="calculating-the-scaled-active-time">Calculating the scaled active time</h5>

    <code><a>iteration start</a> &times;
          <a>iteration duration</a></code>

  If the <a>iteration start</a> is zero, the <a>start offset</a>

<h4 id="scaling-the-time">Scaling the time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

It is often desirable to control the rate at which an <a>animation
node</a> progresses.
For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
momentum and produce a more natural effect.
Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
for the <a>animation node</a> to progress in a series of distinct
steps.

For such situations Web Animations provides <a>timing functions</a>
that scale the progress of an <a>animation node</a>.

<a>Timing functions</a> take an input time fraction and produce
a scaled output time fraction.

</div>

<h4 id="timing-functions">Timing functions</h4>

A <dfn>timing function</dfn> takes an input time fraction in the range

(i.e. positive and negative infinity are permitted).

<a>Animation nodes</a> have one <a>timing function</a> associated with
them.
The default <a>timing function</a> is the <dfn>linear timing
function</dfn> whose output is identical to its input.
The <a>linear timing function</a> can be represented by the string
&ldquo;linear&rdquo;.

The range of timing functions that may be applied to a given
<a>animation node</a> depends on the type of the <a>animation node</a>.

<div class="issue">
Currently, the set of <a>timing functions</a> allowed on
an <a>animation group</a> is not restricted.
This has raised concern about complexity of implementation and also
complexity of behavior with regards to fill modes.
As a result, allowing the full set of timing functions on animation
groups is considered <strong>at risk</strong>.

Alternatives are to either restrict timing functions on animation
groups to the <a>linear timing function</a> or to a set of
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; timing functions that have properties that
alleviate some of the concerns with the more complex timing
functions.

<h4 id="scaling-using-a-cubic-bezier-curve">Scaling using a cubic B&eacute;zier curve</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic B&eacute;zier
curve to scale the time.
The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) while two
control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
the curve.
Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
lie within the range [0, 1] such a curve produces a function that is
used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
(the <var>y</var> values).
This arrangement is illustrated below.

A <dfn>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</dfn> is a type of <a>timing
function</a> defined by four real numbers that specify the two control
points, <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>, of a cubic B&eacute;zier curve whose
end points are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1).
The x coordinates of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> are
restricted to the range [0, 1].

The evaluation of this curve is covered in many sources such as
[[FUND-COMP-GRAPHICS]].

A <a>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</a> may be specified as a string
using the following syntax (using notation from [[!CSS3VAL]]):
<blockquote>
  <div
    class="production"><dfn>&lt;cubic-bezier-timing-function&gt;</dfn> =
    ease | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out |
    <span class="atom">cubic-bezier(&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,
      &lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;)</span></div>
</blockquote>

The meaning of each value is as follows:

:   ease
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1).
:   ease-in
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1).
:   ease-out
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1).
:   ease-in-out
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1).
:   cubic-bezier(&lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt;)
::  Specifies a <a>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</a>.
    The four numbers specify points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> of
    the curve as (x1, y1, x2, y2).
    Both x values must be in the range [0, 1] or the definition is
    invalid.

<div class="issue">
It has been proposed to extend <code>cubic-bezier</code> to allow
multiple segments, using syntax such as the following:

<pre>
<code>cubic-bezier( [ &lt;number&gt;{6} ; ]* &lt;number&gt;{4} )</code>
</pre>

(i.e. the curve starts at (0, 0); each segment is defined by six
numbers where the start point is the end of the previous segment and
the numbers define the two control points and the end point. The
last segment is defined by four numbers since the end point is fixed
at (1, 1).)

This would provide a simple and compact syntax for tools trying to
map arbitrary curves (e.g. bounce functions) to timing functions.

<h4 id="timing-in-discrete-steps">Timing in discrete steps</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>
It is possible to scale an animation node's timing so that the animation node
occurs in a series of discrete steps using a stepping function.

Some example step timing functions are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/step-timing-func-examples.svg" width="700"
      alt="Example step timing functions.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  Example step timing functions.
  In each case the domain is the input time fraction whilst the range
  represents the output time fraction produced by the step
  function.<br>
  The first row shows the function for each transition point when only
  one step is specified whilst the second row shows the same for three
  steps.
</p>

</div>

A <dfn>step timing function</dfn> is a type of <a>timing function</a>
that divides the input time into a specified number of intervals that
are equal in duration.
The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.

In keeping with Web Animations' model of endpoint exclusive
interval timing (see <a href="#interval-timing"
section></a>), the output time at the transition point is
the time <em>after</em> applying the increase (i.e. the top of the
step) with the following exception.

When a transition point coincides with the end of the <a>active
interval</a> extra care must be taken to produce the correct result
when performing a <a title="fill mode">fill</a>.
To achieve this, when a <a>step timing function</a> is
applied to an <a>animation node</a> or applied to an <a>animation
effect</a> associated with an <a>animation node</a>, an additional
<dfn>before flag</dfn> is passed.
The value of the <a>before flag</a> is determined as follows:


1.  If the <a>active time</a> of the animation node is
    <a>unresolved</a>, the <a>before flag</a> is not set and these
    steps should be aborted.
2.  Determine the <var>current direction</var> using the procedure
    defined in <a href="#calculating-the-directed-time"
    section></a>.
3.  If either the <var>current direction</var> is <span
    class="prop-value">forwards</span> or the <a>animation node
    playback rate</a> &ge; 0 (but <em>not</em> when both conditions
    are true),
    let <var>going forwards</var> be true, otherwise it is false.
4.  The <a>before flag</a> is set if the animation node is in the
    <a>before phase</a> and <var>going forwards</var> is true;
    or if the animation node is in the <a>after phase</a> and
    <var>going forwards</var> is false.

When a step timing function is evaluated at a transition point, if
the <a>before flag</a> is set the result is the value <em>before</em>
applying the increase.

A <a>step timing function</a> may be specified as a string
using the following syntax:

<blockquote>
  <div class="production"><dfn>&lt;step-timing-function&gt;</dfn> =
    step-start | step-middle | step-end |
    <span class="atom">steps(&lt;integer&gt;[,
                       [ start | middle | end ] ]?)</span></div>
</blockquote>

The meaning of each value is as follows:

:   step-start
::  Equivalent to steps(1, start);
:   step-middle
::  Equivalent to steps(1, middle);
:   step-end
::  Equivalent to steps(1, end);
:   steps(&lt;integer&gt;[, [ start | middle | end ] ]?)
::  Specifies a <a>step timing function</a>.
    The first parameter specifies the number of intervals in the
    function.
    It must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
    The second parameter, which is optional, specifies the point at
    which the change of values occur within the interval.
    If the second parameter is omitted, it is given the value <span
    class="prop-value">end</span>.

<h4 id="calculating-the-transformed-time">Calculating the transformed time</h4>

The <dfn>transformed time</dfn> is calculated from the
<a>directed time</a> using the following steps:

1.  If the <a>directed time</a> is <a>unresolved</a>,
    return an <a>unresolved</a> <a>time value</a>.
2.  If the <a>iteration duration</a> is infinity,
    return the <a>directed time</a>.
3.  Let <var>iteration fraction</var> be the result of
    evaluating <code><a>directed time</a> / <a>iteration
    duration</a></code> unless <a>iteration duration</a> is
    zero, in which case let <var>iteration fraction</var> be
    zero.
4.  Let <var>scaled fraction</var> be the result of
    evaluating the <a>animation node</a>'s <a>timing function</a>
    with <var>iteration fraction</var> as the input time
    fraction.
5.  Return the result of evaluating <code><var>scaled
    fraction</var> &times; <a>iteration duration</a></code>.
    If the <var>scaled fraction</var> is zero, let the result be
    zero.

    Note: This clarification is needed since the <a>iteration duration</a>
        may be infinity and the result of infinity multiplied by zero is
        undefined according to IEEE 754-2008.


<h3 id="grouping-and-synchronization">Grouping and synchronization</h3>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

While it is possible to set the timing properties of <a>animation
nodes</a> individually, it is often useful to synchronize <a>animation
nodes</a> so that they share common timing properties and maintain
their temporal relationship.  This is achieved using an <a>animation
group</a>.

A simple example is illustrated below.

</div>

An <dfn>animation group</dfn> is a type of <a>animation node</a> that
contains an ordered sequence of zero or more <a>animation nodes</a>
known as <dfn title="child animation node">child animation nodes</dfn>.

At a given moment, an <a>animation node</a> may be a <a>child animation
node</a> of at most one <a>animation group</a> known as the <dfn>parent
animation group</dfn>.
The <a>parent animation group</a> cannot be the same <a>animation
node</a> as the <a>child animation node</a> itself.

By nesting <a>animation groups</a> it is possible to create hierarchical
tree structures.
The following terms are used to describe the parts and properties of
such structures and are defined in [[!DOM]]:

Note: in applying these definitions to <a>animation nodes</a>, the
    term <em>parent</em> refers exclusively to a <a>parent animation
    group</a> and does <em>not</em> include the <a>player</a> which with
    an <a>animation node</a> may be <a
    title="directly associated with a player">directly associated</a>
    despite the fact that conceptually the <a>player</a> acts as a parent
    time source.

The temporal relationship between a <a>child animation node</a> and its
<a>parent animation group</a> is incorporated in the definition of
<a>inherited time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
section></a>).

<h4 id="relationship-of-group-time-to-child-time">Relationship of group time to child time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The timing of the children of an <a>animation group</a> is based on
the timing of the group.
Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
<a>transformed time</a>.
With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
<em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.

For example, if an <a>animation group</a> has an <a>iteration
count</a> of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice
since they effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"
    alt="The effect of multiple iterations on the children of a group.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  Since children of an <a>animation group</a> base their timing on the
  group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
  children play again.
</p>

Note that even in this case, the child <a>animation nodes</a> still
have only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
interval</a> is played twice.

If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
of the children.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-repetition-and-animation-repetition.svg"
    width="600" alt="Iteration counts are multiplicative.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on an <a>animation group</a>
  and an <a>iteration count</a> of 3 on one of its children results in
  that child playing 6 times.
</p>

A further result of the children of an <a>animation group</a> basing
their timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they
cannot animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-clipping.svg" width="600"
    alt="Groups clip the active interval of contained children.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  In the first instance, an <a>animation node</a> has a negative delay
  and an infinite <a>iteration count</a>.<br>
  However, when a similar <a>animation node</a> is placed inside
  an <a>animation group</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a>
  it has the effect of clipping the child <a>animation node</a>'s
  <a>active interval</a>.
</p>

Some further consequences of <a>animation group</a> children basing
their timing on their parent group's <a>transformed time</a> are:

*   Setting the <a title="animation node playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation group</a> will speed up or slow down all
    children.

*   Changing the <a>playback direction</a> of an <a>animation group</a>
    will change the direction of all children.

*   Applying a <a>timing function</a> to an <a>animation group</a> will
    affect the progress of all children.

<h4 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-an-animation-group">The start time of children of an animation group</h4>

The <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> of a <a>child
animation node</a> of an <a>animation group</a> is zero.

Note that specific types of <a>animation groups</a> may override
this definition to provide other kinds of synchronization behavior.

<h4 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-group">The intrinsic iteration duration of an animation group</h4>

The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation
group</a> is based on the time when the last <a>child animation
node</a> completes its <a>active interval</a> and is calculated using
the following procedure.

1.  Define the <a>end time</a> of an <a>animation node</a> as:

    <blockquote>
      <dfn>end time</dfn> =
      <code><a title="animation node start time">start time</a> +
      <a>start delay</a> + <a>active duration</a> + <a>end
      delay</a></code>
    </blockquote>

2.  The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> depends on the number of
    <a>child animation nodes</a> as follows,

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the group has no <a>child animation nodes</a>,
    ::  the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is zero.

    :   Otherwise,
    ::

        1.  Let <var>maximum end time</var> be the maximum value
            after calculating the <a>end time</a> of each <a>child
            animation node</a> in the group.
        2.  The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is the result of
            evaluating <code>max(0, <var>maximum end
            time</var>)</code>.

    </div>

This definition of the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> may be
overridden by specific types of <a>animation groups</a>.

<h4 id="animation-sequences">Animation sequences</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Specific types of <a>animation groups</a> can be used to provide
different kinds of synchronization behavior for their children.
This specification defines one additional type of <a>animation
group</a>: an <a>animation sequence</a>.
<a>Animation sequences</a> arrange the start times of their
children so that they run one at a time, in turn.

Compare the two arrangements illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-types.svg" width="600"
    alt="Animation groups and animation sequences.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  Animation groups and animation sequences.<br>
  (a) is a regular <a>animation group</a> where all the children run
      simultaneously.<br>
  (b) is an <a>animation sequence</a> where the children run in turn.
</p>

Since <a>animation groups</a> can also contain other <a>animation
groups</a>, complex synchronization is possible by combining
different types of groups as illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-nesting.svg" width="600"
    alt="Nesting of animation groups.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  An <a>animation sequence</a> that contains a regular <a>animation

  <a>animation sequence</a> to finish, and then the children of the
  <a>animation group</a> play simultaneously.
  After they have finished the next child of the <a>animation
  sequence</a> plays.
</p>

</div>

An <dfn>animation sequence</dfn> is a type of <a>animation group</a>
that schedules its <a>child animation nodes</a> such that they play in
turn following their order in the group.
This sequencing is achieved by adjusting the <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a> of each <a>child
animation node</a> in the group.

<h5 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-an-animation-sequence">The start time of children of an animation sequence</h5>

The <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> of
a <a>child animation node</a> of an <a>animation sequence</a> is the
<a>end time</a> of the child's <a>previous sibling</a>.
If the child has no <a>previous sibling</a> the start time is zero.

<div class="note">
When the <a>active duration</a> is positive infinity the behavior
for calculating the <a>end time</a> of an <a>animation node</a>
and the <a title="animation node start time">start time</a> of
subsequent children follows the usual behavior defined by IEEE
754-2008.
As a result, if any of the children of an <a>animation
sequence</a> has an infinite <a>active duration</a>, any children
that occur later in the sequence will not play.

Similarly, the above definition does not restrict
<a title="animation node start time">start times</a> to positive
values and hence some children may not play due to a negative
<a>start delay</a> on children that occur earlier in the group
since their <a>active interval</a> may end before the group's <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a>.
</div>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Because the start of the <a>active interval</a> is based on the
sum of an <a>animation node</a>'s <a
title="animation node start time">start time</a> <em>and</em>
<a>start delay</a>, the <a>active intervals</a> of
children of an <a>animation sequence</a> need not run in strict
sequence but can be shifted back and forth by using the <a>start
delay</a> as shown in the following diagram.

A negative <a>start delay</a> can be used to cause the <a>active
interval</a> of two children to overlap.
Note that the <a>start delay</a> affects the <a

children in the group.

</div>

<h5 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-an-animation-sequence">The intrinsic iteration duration of an animation sequence</h5>

The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation

<a>child animation node</a> appended to the group's children
calculated according to the definition in <a
href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-an-animation-sequence"
section></a> unless that produces a negative value, in
which case the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is zero.

As a result, if the <a>animation sequence</a> has no <a>child
animation nodes</a> the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> will be
zero.

</div>

Note: Since <a>timing functions</a> are allowed to produce output times

    The range of <var>p</var> is (&minus;&infin;, &infin;) due to the
    effect of <a>timing functions</a>.
    As a result, this procedure must also define extrapolation

    A common case where the definitions differ is for list-based

    defined as appending to a list

    be defined as component-based addition.
    For example, the filter list values "blur(2)" and

<h4 id="specific-animation-behaviors">Specific animation behaviors</h4>

The specific procedures used for animating a given <a>target
property</a> are referred to as the property's <dfn>animation
behavior</dfn>.

The <a>animation behavior</a> of CSS properties is defined by the
"Animatable:" line in the summary of the property's definition or in
[[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] for properties that lack a such a line.

Issue: The default <a>animation behavior</a> for CSS properties is "as
       string".  Should this be defined here or in CSS Animations Level 4?

For DOM attributes, the <a>animation behavior</a> is defined alongside
the attribute definition.
Unlike CSS properties, if such a definition is not provided the
default <a>animation behavior</a> is &ldquo;<a>not
animatable</a>&rdquo;.

Following is a series of pre-defined <a>animation behaviors</a>.
[[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] provides further CSS-specific <a>animation
behaviors</a>.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a title="animation addition">addition</a> or which are defined as
<dfn>not additive</dfn>, the <a
title="animation addition">addition procedure</a> is simply
<var>V</var><sub>res</sub> = <var>V</var><sub>b</sub>.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a title="animation accumulation">accumulation</a>, the <a
title="animation accumulation">accumulation procedure</a> is identical
to the <a title="animation addition">addition procedure</a> for that
behavior.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a>distance computation</a> or which are defined as <dfn>not
paceable</dfn>, the <a>distance computation</a> procedure is simply
<var>distance</var> = 1.

<h5 id="not-animatable-section">Not animatable</h5>

Some properties are specifically defined as <dfn>not
animatable</dfn>.
For example, properties defining animation parameters are <a>not
animatable</a> since doing so would create complex recursive
behavior.

Unlike other <a>animation behaviors</a>, no procedures for
<a title="animation interpolation">interpolation</a>,
<a title="animation addition">addition</a> and <a>distance
computation</a> are defined for properties whose <a>animation
behavior</a> is <a>not animatable</a> since these properties should
not be modified.

An <a>animation effect</a> that targets a property that is
<a>not animatable</a> will still exhibit the usual behavior for
an <a>animation node</a> such as occupying time in an <a>animation
sequence</a> and delaying the fulfilment of a <a>player</a>'s
<a>current finished promise</a>.

<h4 id="intermediate-animation-values">Intermediate animation values</h4>

Given a <a>time fraction</a>, a <a>current iteration</a>, and an
<a>underlying value</a>, an <a>animation effect</a> produces
an <dfn>intermediate animation value</dfn> for each <a>animatable</a>
<a>target property</a>.
The procedure for calculating this value depends on the specific
type of <a>animation effect</a> and is defined subsequently (see <a
href="#the-intermediate-animation-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
section></a> and <a
href="#the-intermediate-animation-value-of-a-motion-path-animation-effect"
section></a>).

Before being applied to the <a title="target property">target
properties</a>,
these <a>intermediate animation values</a> are composed together using
the process defined in <a href="#combining-animations" section></a>.

<h3 id="combining-animations">Combining animations</h3>
<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

After calculating the <a>intermediate animation values</a> for an
<a>animation effect</a>, they are applied to the <a>animation
effect</a>'s <a title="target property">target properties</a>.

Since it is possible for multiple <a>in effect</a> <a
title="animation">animations</a> to target the same property it is
often necessary to combine the results of several <a>animation
effects</a> together.
This process is called <dfn title='composition'>compositing</dfn> and is
based on establishing an <a>animation stack</a> for each property
targetted by an <a>in effect</a> <a>animation effect</a>.

After compositing the results of <a>animation
effects</a> together, the composited result is combined with other
values specified for the <a>target property</a>.

For a CSS <a>target property</a> the arrangement is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/animation-cascade.svg" width="450"
alt="Overview of the application of intermediate animation values
to their target properties">
</div>
<p class="caption">
Overview of the application of <a>intermediate animation values</a> to
their <a>target properties</a>.<br>
The results of <a>animation effects</a> targetting the same property
are composited together using an <a>animation stack</a>.<br>
The result of this composition is written to an animation stylesheet
that is more important than other stylesheets but less than any
<code>!important</code> rules.
</p>

For a <a>target property</a> that specifies a DOM attribute, the
composited result is combined with the value of the attribute
specified in the DOM or the lacuna value for that attribute if it is
not specified.

For the first part of this operation&mdash;combining <a>intermediate
animation values</a> that target the same <a
title="target property">property</a>&mdash; it is necessary to
determine both
<em>how</em> the <a>animation effects</a>
associated with the <a>animations</a> are combined
with one another,
as well as the <em>order</em> in which they are applied, that is,
their relative <em>priority</em>.

The matter of <em>how</em> <a>intermediate animation values</a> are
combined is governed by the <a>composite operation</a> of
the corresponding <a>animation effects</a>.

The relative <em>priority</em> of <a>intermediate animation values</a>
is determined by an <a>animation stack</a> established for each
animated property.
</div>

<h4 id="the-animation-stack">The animation stack</h4>

Associated with each property <a title="target property">targetted</a>
by one or more <a>animation effects</a> is an <dfn>animation
stack</dfn> that establishes the relative priority of the <a>animation
effects</a>.

The relative priority of any two <a>animation
effects</a>, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, within an <a>animation
stack</a> is established by comparing the properties of the
<a>animations</a> applying <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> as follows:

1.  Let the <dfn>associated player of an animation effect</dfn>
    be the <a>player</a> <a
    title="associated with a player">associated</a> with the
    <a>animation</a> that is applying the <a>animation effect</a> to
    the property with which this <a>animation stack</a> is
    associated.
2.  Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> by applying the following
    conditions in turn until the order is resolved,

    1.  Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> using any <a>custom
        player priority</a> specified for the <a
        title="associated player of an animation effect">associated
        player</a> of each of <var>A</var> and
        <var>B</var> so that lower priorities sort first.
    2.  Sort by the <a>player sequence number</a> so that lower
        sequence numbers sort first.
    3.  Sort <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> in <a>tree order</a>.
        (By this point, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> must have the
        same <a>player</a> since otherwise the order would have been
        resolved in the previous step.)

<a>Animation effects</a> that sort earlier have <em>lower</em>
priority.

<h5 id="the-custom-player-priority">The custom player priority</h5>

Each <a>player</a> has an associated numeric <dfn>custom player
priority</dfn> that is used to provide high-level control of
animation priority for specifications layered on top of Web
Animations.
The initial value of the <a>custom player priority</a> is zero.

<div class="note">

Note that the <a>custom player priority</a> is primarily
intended to be used to prioritize animations at
a high-level, such as to prioritize animations <em>by type</em>.
For example, it can be used to ensure that CSS Animations always
override CSS Transitions.

It is possible to control animation priority at a lower-level by
setting the <a>player start time</a> appropriately,
(possibly after making compensatory adjustments to the <a>start
delay</a> of the <a>source content</a>) or influencing the
<a>player sequence number</a> by controlling when <a>players</a>
are created.

</div>

<h4 id="calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack">Calculating the result of an animation stack</h4>

In order to calculate the final value of an <a>animation stack</a>,
the <a>intermediate animation values</a> of each
<a>animation effect</a> in the stack are combined in order of priority
from lowest to highest priority.

Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>animation stack</a> takes
an <dfn>underlying value</dfn> as input.

For each <a>animation effect</a> in the stack, the appropriate
<a>intermediate animation value</a> from the <a>animation effect</a>
is combined with the <a>underlying value</a> to produce a new value.
This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining
the next <a>animation effect</a> in the stack.

The final value of an <a>animation stack</a>, called the
<dfn>composited value</dfn>, is simply the result of combining the
<a>intermediate animation value</a> of the final (highest priority)
<a>animation effect</a> in the stack with the <a>underlying value</a>
at that point.

<h4 id="animation-composition">Animation composition</h4>

The specific operation used to combine an <a>intermediate animation
value</a> with an <a>underlying value</a> is determined by the
<dfn>composite operation</dfn> of the <a>animation effect</a> that
produced the <a>intermediate animation value</a>.

This specification defines three <a>composite operations</a> as
follows:

:   <dfn title="composite operation replace">replace</dfn>
::  The result of compositing the <a>intermediate animation value</a>
    with the <a>underlying value</a> is simply the <a>intermediate
    animation value</a>.
:   <dfn title="composite operation add">add</dfn>
::  The <a>intermediate animation value</a> is <a
    title="animation addition">added</a> to the <a>underlying
    value</a>.
    For <a>animation behaviors</a> where the
    <a title="animation addition">addition operation</a> is defined
    such that it is not commutative, the order of the operands is
    <code><a>underlying value</a> + <a>intermediate animation
    value</a></code>.
:   <dfn title="composite operation accumulate">accumulate</dfn></dt>
::  The <a>intermediate animation value</a> is <a
    title="animation accumulation">accumulated</a>
    onto the <a>underlying value</a>.
    For <a>animation behaviors</a> where the
    <a title="animation accumulation">accumulation operation</a> is
    defined such that it is not commutative, the order of the operands
    is <a>underlying value</a> followed by <a>intermediate animation
    value</a>.

<h4 id="applying-the-composited-result">Applying the composited result</h4>

The process for a applying a <a>composited value</a> depends on if the
<a>target property</a> refers to a CSS property or a DOM attribute.

<h5 id="applying-the-result-to-a-css-property">Applying the result to a CSS property</h5>

Applying a <a>composited value</a> to a CSS <a>target property</a>
depends on establishing an <a>animation stylesheet</a>.

The <dfn>animation stylesheet</dfn> contains
<a title="composited value">composited animation values</a>
and acts with a higher priority than all other stylesheets.
However, <code>!important</code> rules from all other stylesheets
act with a higher priority than the <a>animation stylesheet</a>.
The <a>animation stylesheet</a> is regenerated each time the
animation model is updated (see <a href="#animation-effects"
section></a>).

The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a CSS <a>target
property</a> is applied using the following process.

1.  Calculate the <var>base value</var> of the property as
    the value generated for that property by computing the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#used-value">used
    value</a> [[!CSS21]] for that property in the absence of the
    <a>animation stylesheet</a>.
2.  Establish the <a>animation stack</a> for the property (see <a
    href="#the-animation-stack" section></a>).
3.  Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>animation
    stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the property
    as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack"
    section></a>).
4.  Insert the <a>composited value</a> into the <a>animation
    stylesheet</a>.

<h5 id="applying-the-composited-result-to-a-dom-attribute">Applying the composited result to a DOM attribute</h5>

DOM attributes are, unless otherwise specified, <a>not
animatable</a>.
For each attribute that has a specific <a>animation behavior</a>
associated with it, an attribute value to use when the attribute is
not specified or in error must be defined, referred to as the
<dfn>lacuna value</dfn>.
For example, SVG2 ([[SVG2]]) defines <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/intro.html#TermLacunaValue">lacunae
values</a> for its attributes.

The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a DOM attribute <a>target
property</a> is applied using the following process.

1.  Let the <var>base value</var> of the property be the value
    specified for attribute in the DOM or,
    if the attribute value is not specified in the DOM, the
    <a>lacuna value</a> for that attribute.
2.  Establish the <a>animation stack</a> for the property (see <a
    href="#the-animation-stack" section></a>).</li>
3.  Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>animation
    stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the attribute
    as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-animation-stack"
    section></a>).</li>
4.  Record the <a>composited value</a> as the <dfn>animated
    attribute value</dfn> of the attribute.

The <a>animated attribute value</a> does not replace the value of
the attribute in the DOM although it may be accessible via some
other interface.
For all intents and purposes other than interaction with DOM
interfaces, user agents must treat the <a>animated attribute
value</a> as the attribute value.

<h4 id="animation-accumulation-section">Animation accumulation</h4>

Similar to the compositing performed between <a>intermediate animation
values</a> (see <a href="#animation-composition"
section></a>), the <dfn>iteration composite operation</dfn>
determines how values are combined between successive iterations of
the same <a>animation</a>.

This specification defines two <a>iteration composite operations</a>
as follows:

:   <dfn title="iteration composite operation replace">replace</dfn>
::  Each successive iteration is calculated independently of previous
    iterations.
:   <dfn title="iteration composite operation accumulate">accumulate
::  Successive iterations of the animation are <a
    title="animation accumulation">accumulated</a> with the
    final value of the previous iteration.

    The application of the <a>iteration composite operation</a> is
    incorporated in the calculation of the <a>intermediate animation
    value</a> for each type of <a>animation effect</a>.

<h3 id="keyframe-animation-effects">Keyframe animation effects</h3>

A <dfn>keyframe animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
that produces <a>intermediate animation values</a> for its <a>target
properties</a> by interpolating between a series of property values
positioned at fractional offsets.

Each set of property values indexed by an offset is called
a <dfn>keyframe</dfn>.

The <dfn title="keyframe offset">offset of a keyframe</dfn> is a value
in the range [0, 1] or the special value null.
The list of <a>keyframes</a> for a <a>keyframe animation effect</a> is
<dfn>loosely sorted by offset</dfn> which means that for each
<a>keyframe</a> in the list that has a <a>keyframe offset</a> that is
not null, the offset is greater than or equal to the offset of the
previous <a>keyframe</a> in the list with a <a>keyframe offset</a> that
is not null, if any.

The behavior when <a>keyframes</a> overlap or have unsupported values
is defined in <a
href="#the-intermediate-animation-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
section></a>.

Each keyframe also has a <a>timing function</a> associated with it
that is applied to the period of time between the keyframe on which it
is specified and the <em>next</em> keyframe in the list.
The <a>timing function</a> specified on the last keyframe in the
list is never applied.

In addition to the <a>composite operation</a> specified on the
<a>animation effect</a>, each <a>keyframe</a> may also have an
associated <a>composite operation</a> that is applied to all values
specified in that <a>keyframe</a>.
If no <a>composite operation</a> is specified for a <a>keyframe</a>,
the <a>composite operation</a> specified for the <a>animation
effect</a> is used.

<h4 id="spacing-keyframes">Spacing keyframes</h4>
<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

It is often useful to be able to provide a series of property values
without having calculate the <a>keyframe offset</a> of each value in
time but instead to rely on some automatic spacing.

For example, rather than typing:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue', offset: 0 },
               { color: 'green', offset: 1/3 },
               { color: 'red', offset: 2/3 },
               { color: 'yellow', offset: 1 } ], 2000);
</pre>

It should be possible to type the following and allow the user agent
to calculate the <a title="keyframe offset">offset</a> of each
keyframe:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue' },
               { color: 'green' },
               { color: 'red' },
               { color: 'yellow' } ], 2000);
</pre>

Web Animations provides spacing modes for this purpose. The default
spacing mode for keyframe animation effects is
&ldquo;<a
title="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a>&rdquo; which
produces the result described above.

The other spacing mode, &ldquo;<a
title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>&rdquo;, is useful when
it is desirable to maintain an even rate of change such as for <a
href="#motion-path-animation-effects">motion path animation</a>.

For example, consider the following animation:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate([ { left: '0px' },
               { left: '-20px' },
               { left: '100px' },
               { left: '50px' } ], 1000);
</pre>

The resulting value of the <span class="prop-name">left</span>
property is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-distribute.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the distribute spacing mode.
The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs for each segment as indicated the varying slope of the graph.">
</div>
<p class="caption">

<a title="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a> spacing
mode.
The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs

</p>

We can use the <a title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>
spacing mode as follows:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate(
  new KeyframeEffect([ { left: '0px' },
                       { left: '-20px' },
                       { left: '100px' },
                       { left: '50px' } ], { spacing: "paced" }), 1000);
</pre>

The result is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-paced.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the paced spacing mode.
The absolute value of the slope is graph is equal for all segments of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
The animated value of the left property over time when applying the
<a title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a> spacing mode.
The absolute value of the slope is graph is equal for all segments
of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.
</p>

It is also possible to combine fixed <a>keyframe offsets</a> with
spacing modes as follows:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate(
  new KeyframeEffect([ { left: '0px' },
                       { left: '-20px' },
                       { left: '100px', offset: 0.5 },
                       { left: '50px' } ], { spacing: "paced" }), 1000);
</pre>

The result is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-paced-with-offset.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the paced spacing mode and a fixed offset that puts the 100px value at 0.5.

</div>
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>

Before calculating animation values from a <a>keyframe animation
effect</a>, an absolute value must be computed for the <a>keyframe
offset</a> of each <a>keyframe</a> with a null offset.
The values computed depend on the <dfn>keyframe spacing mode</dfn>
specified for the <a>keyframe animation effect</a>.
The keyframe spacing modes are:

:   <dfn title="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</dfn></dt>
::  Indicates that <a>keyframes</a> with a null <a>keyframe offset</a>
    null are positioned so that the difference between subsequent
    <a>keyframe offsets</a> are equal.
:   <dfn title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</dfn></dt>
::  Indicates that <a>keyframes</a> with a null <a>keyframe offset</a>
    null are positioned so that the <em>distance</em> between subsequent
    values of a specified <dfn>paced property</dfn> are equal.
    The distance is calculated using the <a>distance computation</a>
    procedure defined by the <a>animation behavior</a> associated
    with the <a>paced property</a>.

<h5 id="applying-spacing-to-keyframes">Applying spacing to keyframes</h5>

We define a generic procedure for <dfn>evenly distributing
a keyframe</dfn>, <var>keyframe</var>, between two reference
keyframes, <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>, whose <a>keyframe
offsets</a> are <em>not</em> null, as follows:

1.  Let <dfn>offset<sub><var>k</var></sub></dfn> be the <a>keyframe
    offset</a> of a <a>keyframe</a> <var>k</var>.
2.  Let <var>n</var> be the number of keyframes <em>between</em> and
    including <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> minus 1.
3.  Let <var>index</var> refer to the position of
    <var>keyframe</var> in the sequence of keyframes between
    <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> such that the first keyframe
    after <var>start</var> has an <var>index</var> of 1.
4.  Set the <a>keyframe offset</a> of <var>keyframe</var> to
    <a title="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>start</var></sub> +
    (<a title="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>end</var></sub> &minus;
     <a title="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>start</var></sub>)
    &times; <var>index</var> / <var>n</var>.

The computed <a>keyframe offset</a> values of each <a>keyframe</a>
with a null keyframe offset are determined using the following
procedure.

1.  Let <var>keyframes</var> refer to the list of <a>keyframes</a>
    associated with the <a>keyframe animation effect</a>.
2.  If <var>keyframes</var> contains more than one
    <a>keyframe</a> and the <a>keyframe offset</a> of
    the first <a>keyframe</a> in <var>keyframes</var> is null,
    set the <a>keyframe offset</a> of
    the first <a>keyframe</a> to 0.
3.  If the <a>keyframe offset</a> of the last <a>keyframe</a> in
    <var>distributed keyframes</var> is null, set its
    <a>keyframe offset</a> to 1.
4.  For each pair of <a>keyframes</a> <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
    where:

    *   <var>A</var> appears before <var>B</var> in
        <var>keyframes</var>, and
    *   <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have a <a>keyframe
        offset</a> that is not null, and
    *   all <a>keyframes</a> between <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
        have a null <a>keyframe offset</a>,

    calculate the <a>keyframe offset</a> of
    each <a>keyframe</a> between <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
    depending on the <a>keyframe spacing mode</a> as follows:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the <a title="keyframe spacing mode">spacing mode</a>
        is <a title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>,</dt>
    ::

        1.  Define a keyframe as <dfn>paceable</dfn> if it
            contains a value for the <a>paced property</a>.
        2.  Let <var>paced A</var> be the first keyframe in the
            range [<var>A</var>, <var>B</var>] that is
            <a>paceable</a>, if any.
        3.  Let <var>paced B</var> be the last keyframe in the
            range [<var>A</var>, <var>B</var>] that is
            <a>paceable</a>, if any.
        4.  If there is no <var>paced A</var> or <var>paced
            B</var> let both refer to <var>B</var>.
            <!-- FIXME: I want to mark this up as an inline note but

            <span>Note that in this case, the spacing

        5.  For each keyframe in the range

Note: although the above procedure defines computing keyframe
    offsets in terms of overwriting null values, user agents that
    implement the <a href="#programming-interface">programming
    interface</a> are required to maintain the original null values as
    well as calculating the computed offsets.
    This is because the <code>getFrames</code> method of the
    <a>KeyframeEffect</a> interface returns keyframe offsets both
    before and after applying spacing.

Issue: The above algorithm is quite complex.
    It attempts to cover all possible combinations of input where
    keyframe offsets and or paced property values may be missing.
    Furthermore, it attempts to do this in a way that degenerates
    consistently and also allows the author to combine fixed offsets
    with either pacing or distribute spacing.
    We await implementation experience to determine if the complexity
    is justified.

    create a new <a>keyframe</a> with a <a>keyframe offset</a> of 1,
    a property value set to the <a>neutral value for composition</a>,
    and a <a>composite operation</a> of <a
    title="composite operation add">add</a>, and append it to the
    end of <var>property-specific keyframes</var>.
9.  Let <var>interval endpoints</var> be an empty sequence of
    keyframes.
10. Populate <var>interval points</var> by following the steps from
    the first matching condition from below:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If <var>time fraction</var> &lt; 0 and there is more
        than one <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific
        keyframes</var> with a <a>keyframe offset</a> of
        0,
    ::  Add the first <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific
        keyframes</var> to <var>interval endpoints</var>.
    :   If <var>time fraction</var> &ge; 1 and there is more
        than one <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific
        keyframes</var> with a <a>keyframe offset</a> of
        1,
    ::  Add the last <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific
        keyframes</var> to <var>interval endpoints</var>.
    :   Otherwise,
    ::

        1.  Append to <var>interval endpoints</var> the last
            <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific
            keyframes</var> whose <a>keyframe offset</a> is less than
            or equal to <var>time fraction</var> and less than 1.  If
            there is no such <a>keyframe</a> (because, for example,
            the <a>time fraction</a> is negative), add the last
            <a>keyframe</a> whose <a>keyframe offset</a> is 0.
        2.  Append to <var>interval endpoints</var> the next
            <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific keyframes</var>
            after the one added in the previous step.

    </div>

11. For each <var>keyframe</var> in <var>interval endpoints</var>:

    1.  If <var>keyframe</var> has a <a>composite operation</a>
        that is <em>not</em> <a
        title="composite operation replace">replace</a>, or
        <var>keyframe</var> has no <a>composite operation</a>
        and the <a>composite operation</a> of this <a>keyframe
        animation effect</a> is <em>not</em> <a
        title="composite operation replace">replace</a>, then
        perform the following steps:

        1.  Let <var>composite operation to use</var> be the
            <a>composite operation</a> of <var>keyframe</var>, or if
            it has none, the <a>composite operation</a> of this
            <a>keyframe animation effect</a>.
        2.  Let <var>value to combine</var> be the property value of
            <var>target property</var> specified on
            <var>keyframe</var>.
        3.  Replace the property value of <var>target property</var>
            on <var>keyframe</var> with the result of combining
            <var>underlying value</var> (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) and
            <var>value to combine</var> (<var>V</var><sub>b</sub>)
            using the <var>composite operation to use</var>
            procedure defined by the <var>target property</var>'s
            <a>animation behavior</a>.

    2.  If this <a>keyframe animation effect</a> has an <a>iteration
        composite operation</a> of <a
        title="iteration composite operation accumulate">accumulate</a>,
        apply the following step <var>current iteration</var> times:

        *   replace the property value of <var>target property</var>
            on <var>keyframe</var> with the result of combining the
            property value (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) with the
            property value on the final keyframe in
            <var>property-specific keyframes</var>
            (<var>V</var><sub>b</sub>) using the <a
            title="animation accumulation">accumulation procedure</a>
            defined for <var>target property</var>.

        Issue: It seems like this could be done as a separate step at the end
            and applied to all types of animation effects consistently.

12. If there is only one keyframe in <var>interval endpoints</var>
    return the property value of <var>target property</var> on that
    keyframe.
13. Let <var>start offset</var> be the <a>keyframe offset</a> of the
    first keyframe in <var>interval endpoints</var>.
14. Let <var>end offset</var> be the <a>keyframe offset</a> of
    last keyframe in <var>interval endpoints</var>.
15. Let <var>interval distance</var> be the result of evaluating
    <code>(<var>time fraction</var> - <var>start offset</var>) /
    (<var>end offset</var> - <var>start offset</var>)</code>
16. Return the result of applying the <a
    title="animation interpolation">interpolation procedure</a> defined
    by the <a>animation behavior</a> of the <var>target property</var>,
    to the values of the <var>target property</var> specified on the
    two keyframes in <var>interval endpoints</var> taking the first such
    value as <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and the second as
    <var>V</var><sub>end</sub> and using <var>interval
    distance</var> as the interpolation parameter <var>p</var>.

<div class="note">

    Note that this procedure assumes the following about the list of
    <a>keyframes</a> specified on the effect:</p>

    *   Each <a>keyframe</a> has a specified <a>keyframe offset</a> in
        the range [0, 1].
    *   The list of <a>keyframes</a> is sorted in ascending order by
        <a>keyframe offset</a>.
    *   Each specified property value is a valid and supported value.
    *   For a given property, there is a most one specified property
        value on each keyframe.

    It is the responsibility of the user of the model (for example,
    a declarative markup or programming interface) to ensure these
    conditions are met.

    For example, for the <a href="#programming-interface">programming
    interface</a> defined by this specification, these conditions are
    met by applying the normalization defined in <a
    href="#normalizing-a-sequence-of-keyframes" section></a>
    and resolving null <a>keyframe offsets</a> by
    applying <a href="#spacing-keyframes">spacing behavior</a>.

</div>

Note: this procedure permits overlapping <a>keyframes</a>.
    The behavior is that at the point of overlap the output value jumps to
    the value of the last defined <a>keyframe</a> at that offset.
    For overlapping frames at 0 or 1, the output value for <a
    title="time fraction">time fractions</a> less than 0 or greater than
    or equal to 1 is the value of the first <a>keyframe</a> or the last
    <a>keyframe</a> in <var>keyframes</var> respectively.

<div class="issue">
    In the presence of certain timing functions, the input time
    fraction to an animation effect is not limited to the range [0, 1].
    Currently, however, keyframe offsets <em>are</em> limited to the
    range [0, 1] and property values are simply extrapolated for input
    time fractions outside this range.

    We have considered removing this restriction since some cases exist
    where it is useful to be able to specify non-linear
    changes in property values at time fractions outside the range
    [0, 1].
    One example is an animation that interpolates from green to yellow
    but has an overshoot timing function that makes it temporarily
    interpolate &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; yellow to red before settling back
    to yellow.

    While this effect could be achieved by modification of the keyframes
    and timing function, this approach seems to break the model's
    separation of timing concerns from animation effects.

    It is not clear how this effect should be achieved but we note that
    allowing keyframe offsets outside [0, 1] may make the currently
    specified behavior where keyframes at offset 0 and 1 are synthesized
    as necessary, inconsistent.

<h3 id="motion-path-animation-effects">Motion path animation effects</h3>

A <dfn>motion path animation effect</dfn> is an <a>animation effect</a>
that produces animation values for the transform <a>target
property</a> of an <a>animation target</a> such that it follows
a geometric curve commonly referred to as a &ldquo;motion path&rdquo;.

The <dfn>motion path</dfn> of a <a>motion path animation effect</a> is
defined by an SVG Path, as specified by SVG [[!SVG2]].
A <a>motion path</a> consists of a list of <dfn
title="path command">path commands</dfn> (see <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathData">path data</a>
[[!SVG2]]).

Amongst the different types of path commands, we define
<dfn title="orientation path command">orientation path commands</dfn> as
<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathDataMovetoCommands">moveto</a>
commands and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#PathDataBearingCommands">bearing</a>
commands.
All types of path commands that are <em>not</em> <a>orientation
path commands</a> are referred to as <dfn
title="drawing path command">drawing path commands</dfn>.

The <dfn>automatic rotation flag</dfn> of a <a>motion path animation
effect</a>, if set, specifies that the <a>intermediate animation
value</a> generated by the <a>motion path animation effect</a> produces
a rotation that matches the directional tangent vector of the
<a>motion path</a>.

The <dfn>rotation angle</dfn> parameter of a <a>motion path animation
effect</a> specifies a constant rotation that applies to the target
transform in addition to any rotation generated by setting the
<a>automatic rotation flag</a>.

<h4 id="distance-along-a-path-section">Distance along a path</h4>

The procedure used for calculating the length of a path or
a subsection is provided by the definition of <dfn><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/paths.html#DistanceAlongAPath">distance
along a path</a></dfn> in SVG [[!SVG2]].

<h4 id="spacing-motion-paths">Spacing motion paths</h4>

The following properties control the rate of progress of a <a>motion
path animation effect</a>:

:   <dfn title="motion path spacing mode">spacing mode</dfn>
::  Specifies the strategy used for determining the offset of each
    <a>spacing point</a> or <a>path command</a> when not specified by
    a <a>point offset</a>.
    The possible spacing modes are identical to those defined for
    <a>keyframe animation effects</a> (see <a
    href="#spacing-keyframes" section></a>).

    Note that a spacing mode of <a
    title="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a> has no
    effect if <a>point offsets</a> are specified.
    This is because spacing <em>between</em> <a>point offsets</a>
    always uses <a title="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>
    spacing mode.
:   <dfn title="spacing point">spacing points</dfn>
::  An optional sequence of real numbers in the range [0.0, 1.0] that
    correspond to fractions of the total path length.
    The animation effect produces animation values such that the
    <a>animation target</a> moves backwards and forwards along the
    <a>motion path</a> following the sequence indicated by these
    points.

    Furthermore, the point on the <a>motion path</a> indicated by each
    such number forms a handle that may be associated with a <a>point
    offset</a> or positioned by the <a
    title="motion path spacing mode">spacing mode</a>.
:   <dfn title="point offset">point offsets</dfn>
::  An optional ordered sequence of real numbers in the range [0.0,
    1.0] that specifies the <a>time fraction</a> when the
    corresponding <a>spacing point</a>, or, if <a>spacing points</a>
    are not provided, <a>drawing path command</a>, should be visited.

    If specified, the first value in the sequence must be 0.0 and the
    last value must be 1.0.
    There must be as many items in the sequence of <a>point
    offsets</a> as in the sequence of <a>spacing points</a>, if
    provided.
    If a sequence of <a>spacing points</a> is not provided,
    the number of items in <a>point offsets</a> must equal the number
    of <a>drawing path commands</a> in the <a>motion path</a> plus
    one.
:   <dfn title="point easing">point easing</dfn>
::  An optional ordered sequence of <a>timing functions</a> that
    specify the easing behavior between each pair of <a>spacing
    points</a>, or, if <a>spacing points</a> are not provided, between
    each pair of <a>drawing path commands</a>.

    If specified, there must be as many items as in
    the sequence of <a>spacing points</a> minus one, if provided.
    If a sequence of <a>spacing points</a> is not provided,
    the number of items in <a>point easing</a> must equal the number
    of <a>drawing path commands</a> in the <a>motion path</a>.

Note: the above descriptions of the length of each list
    represent the requirements of the model.
    Users of the model such as markup or programming interfaces
    may fulfill these requirements, for example, by defining padding
    behavior or error handling.

Issue: Need a diagram here showing how the different combinations work.

<h5 id="applying-spacing-to-motion-paths">Applying spacing to motion paths</h5>

The end result of applying spacing is:

*   a sequence of <a>effective spacing points</a>,
*   a sequence of <a>effective point offsets</a>, and
*   a sequence of <a>effective point easing</a>
    <a>timing functions</a>.

The sequence of <dfn>effective spacing points</dfn> is determined by
following the steps associated with the first matching condition
from below:

<div class="switch">

:   If there are no <a>drawing path commands</a>,
::  Let <a>effective spacing points</a> be an empty sequence.
:   If <a>spacing points</a> is specified,

    points</a>.
:   Otherwise,</dt>
::  Perform the following steps:

    1.  Let <a>effective spacing points</a> be a sequence
        consisting of the single element 0.
    2.  For each <a>drawing path command</a> in <a>path
        commands</a>, append to <a>effective spacing points</a>
        a number equal to the <a>distance along a path</a> up to
        the point at the end of the given <a>path command</a>,
        divided by the total path length.

The <dfn>path fraction</dfn> for a given <a>time fraction</a>,
<var>progress</var>, is determined using the following procedure:

1.  If <a>effective point offsets</a> is empty, let <a>path
    fraction</a> equal <a>time fraction</a> and abort these steps.
2.  If <a>effective point offsets</a> has only one item, let <a>path
    fraction</a> equal the value of the one item in <a>effective
    spacing points</a> and abort these steps.

    Note: <a>Effective point offsets</a> can only have one item if
        <a>spacing points</a> has exactly one item. In this case, the
        <a>effective point offsets</a> will always be a list containing
        just the value 0.

3.  If <var>progress</var> &ge; 1, let the <a>path fraction</a> equal
    the value of the <em>last</em> item in <a>effective point
    offsets</a> and abort these steps.
4.  If <var>progress</var> &lt; 0, let the <a>path fraction</a> equal
    the value of the <em>first</em> item in <a>effective point
    offsets</a> and abort these steps.
5.  Let <var>start index</var> and <var>end index</var> represent
    the zero-based indices of the <em>last</em> pair of successive
    values in <var>effective point offsets</var> such that <var>start
    offset</var> &le; <var>progress</var> &le; <var>end offset</var>.
6.  Let <var>interval fraction</var> be the ratio of the difference
    between <var>progress</var> and the offset at <var>start
    index</var>, and the difference between the offset at <var>end
    index</var> and the offset at <var>start index</var>.
7.  Let <var>scaled interval fraction</var> be the result of applying
    the <a>timing function</a> from <a>effective point easing</a>
    at index <var>start index</var> with <var>interval fraction</var>
    as the input.
8.  Let <var>segment start</var> and <var>segment end</var> be the
    values in <a>effective spacing points</a> at the indicies
    <var>start index</var> and <var>end index</var> respectively.
9.  Let the <a>path fraction</a> be the result of evaluating the
    following formula:
    <code><var>scaled interval fraction</var> *
    (<var>segment end</var> - <var>segment start</var>) +
    <var>segment start</var></code>.

<h4 id="the-intermediate-animation-value-of-a-motion-path-animation-effect">The intermediate animation value of a motion path animation effect</h4>

The <a>intermediate animation value</a> of a <a>motion path animation
effect</a> for a given <var>time fraction</var>, <var>current
iteration</var>, and <var>underlying value</var> is given by the
following process:

1.  Let <var>distance</var> be the <a>path fraction</a> for the given
    <a>time fraction</a>.
2.  Let <var>displacement</var> be the point located
    <var>distance</var> along the <a>motion path</a> using the
    definition for <a>distance along a path</a>.

    If <var>distance</var> indicates a point on the path that is
    coincidental with one or more <a>orientation path
    commands</a>, <var>displacement</var> is the point
    <em>after</em> all <a>orientation path commands</a> (this will
    be the <em>start</em> of the next <a>drawing path command</a> if
    there is one).
3.  Let the <var>translation component</var> be the translation
    transform required to transform the point at the start of
    <a>motion path</a> to <var>displacement</var>.
4.  Calculate the <var>rotation component</var> according to the
    first match condition from the following:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the <a>automatic rotation flag</a> is set,
    ::  the <var>rotation component</var> is a transform representing
        the sum of:

        *   the angle of the tangent vector at
            <var>displacement</var>, and
        *   the <a>rotation angle</a>.

    :  Otherwise,
    ::  the <var>rotation component</var> is a transform representing
        the <a>rotation angle</a>.

    </div>

    When calculating the angle of the tangent vector, if there are
    no <a>drawing path commands</a> in the <a>motion path</a>, the
    the angle should be taken to be zero.

    <div class="issue">

        The original text for this section contained the following
        qualifications but I'm not sure how meaningful they are:

        *   For continuous <a>path commands</a> (all elements except
            moveto), the angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of
            these calculations is defined to be an integer multiple of
            2&pi; different from the value given by <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_angle">standard
            mathematical formulae for tangents to curves in
            2 dimensional space</a>.
        *   For moveto <a>path commands</a>, which are discontinuous, the
            angle of the tangent vector for the purpose of these
            calculations is always an integer multiple of 2&pi;.
        *   The initial value of the angle of the tangent vector is
            computed using the first element of the curve, and is always
            in the range [0, 2&pi;).
        *   Single continuous path commands must never produce tangent
            vector angles that are discontinuous over their defined
            region. This implies that a single unique solution is
            available for all points on continuous path commands.
        *   When computing angles after discontinuous or non-smooth
            jumps, multiple possible solutions may be available.  These
            solutions will differ by integer multiples of 2&pi;.  In
            such cases the solution that lies closest to the previous
            tangent angle is used.

    </div>

5.  Let the <var>transform value</var> be the result of
    by constructing a transform list consisting of the
    <var>translation component</var> followed by the <var>rotation
    component</var>.

    Issue: What's the value in keeping these separate?
        Shouldn't we collapse them?

6.  Let the <var>unaccumulated value</var> be the result of

        the first five steps of this procedure using a <var>time
        fraction</var> of 1.
    2.  Perform the following step <var>current iteration</var> times:

        *   Set the <var>intermediate animation value</var> to the
            result of combining the current value of
            <var>intermediate animation value</var>
            (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) with
            <var>final transform value</var>

<h3 id="custom-effects">Custom effects</h3>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In some situations the <a>animation
effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties.
They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
affecting the document content.

In such cases, where the provided <a>animation
effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
script may be used.
Such <a>custom effects</a> receive a <a>time
fraction</a> and <a>current iteration</a> from the timing model and
are responsible for producing an effect corresponding to the specified
time.

Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
or creating vibrations.

For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
element, it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
SVG.
Compared to using <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">Timing control for
script-based animations</a>,
this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
additional programming.

</div>

A <dfn>custom effect</dfn> is an author-defined programming callback
that is passed timing information when <a>sampling</a> is performed.

<h4 id="sampling-custom-effects">Sampling custom effects</h4>

<a>Custom effects</a> are called for each referencing <a>animation</a>
when a <a title='single-sample'>sample</a> is performed based on the 
following criteria.

1.  If, on the previous sample, the <a>animation</a> referencing the
    <a>custom effect</a>:

    *   was <a>in effect</a>, and
    *   referenced this same <a>custom effect</a>, and
    *   had a different <a>animation target</a>

    Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>time fraction</a> and
    the <a>animation target</a> from the previous sample as parameters to
    the callback.
2.  Call the callback for the current <a>animation target</a> based on
    the first matching condition from the following:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the <a>animation</a> referencing the custom effect is not
        <a>in effect</a> but was <a>in effect</a> in the previous
        sample,
    ::  Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>time fraction</a> and
        the current <a>animation target</a> as parameters to the callback.
    :   Otherwise, if the <a>animation</a> referencing the custom
        effect:
    ::

        *   <strong>is <a>in effect</a>, and</strong>
        *   <strong>was not <a>in effect</a> in the previous 
            <a title='single-sample'>sample</a>, or
              was <a>in effect</a> but with a different <a>time
              fraction</a> or <a>current iteration</a>,</strong>

    ::   Call the callback passing with the referencing
        <a>animation</a>'s current <a>time fraction</a> and <a>animation
        target</a> as parameters to the callback.

    </div>

<div class="issue">
There may be use cases where an action needs to be triggered at
a specific point in an animation tree.
In many cases this can be achieved by inserting a custom effect with
a step-start easing that spans the period during which the action
should be triggered.
However, this can impose additional layout requirements on the
content which might be cumbersome to accomodate.

Some alternatives under consideration:

*   Additional calling conditions could be defined to accommodate
    zero-width custom effects. For example, it could be required
    that the callback be called if (given infinite precision) there
    was a time between the previous and current sample times that
    aligned with the custom effect.
*   Instead of adding special calling conditions to custom effects,
    a new type of animation node, Trigger, could be introduced. The
    trigger would only ever act as a zero-width custom effect as
    described above, its constructor would take a callback function,
    but not require a target or timing. It could also specify other
    calling conventions, for example whether it should only trigger
    in a specific playback direction.

</div>

<h4 id="execution-order-of-custom-effects">Execution order of custom effects</h4>

Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
title="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
a single <a>target property</a>, the steps for assessing their
order of execution differs from <a>animation effects</a>.f

<a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
<a>animation effects</a> have completed and
applied their result to their targets (see <a
href="#applying-the-composited-result" section></a>).

Issue: Need to define this more precisely.
    Are styles flushed?
    Presumably they are.
    Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
    animation effects and just do it once afterwards?

Within the set of <a>custom effects</a>, the
order of execution is the same as that defined for <a title="animation
effect">animation effects</a> in <a href="#the-animation-stack" section></a>.
Items sorted earlier are executed before those sorted later.

The <var>effect</var> parameter, an ECMAScript value passed to the

may specify an {{EffectCallback}}, an {{AnimationEffect}},
a <a>Keyframe</a> a sequence of <a>Keyframes</a>, or <span

However, since callback functions and dictionaries are not
distinguishable in WebIDL, we define the processing of this

The <dfn>procedure for converting an effect to an IDL value</dfn>
with parameter <var>effect</var> is as follows:

<div class="switch">

    <var>effect</var> as the <var>frames</var> parameter.

Note: since the processing of this parameter is defined in prose, the
    above steps will take place after any coercion is applied to other
    parameters passed to the same operation.

<h4 id="creating-a-new-animation-object">Creating a new <code>Animation</code> object</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The <a>Animation</a> constructor offers a number of approaches to
creating a new <a>Animation</a> object.
At its simplest, an <a>Animation</a> object that changes the
&lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100px over three
seconds can be achieved as follows:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3000);
</pre>

The second parameter, representing the <a>animation effect</a>, may
specify multiple properties, an {{AnimationEffect}} object, or
even a callback function.

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var animA = new Animation(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3000);

// Specify multiple frames
var animB = new Animation(elem, [ { left: '100px' }, { left: '300px' } ], 3000);

// Share the animation effect of another animation
var animC = new Animation(elem, animB.effect, 3000);

// Supply a specialized animation effect
var animD = new Animation(elem,
                          new MotionPathEffect("M100 250C100 50 400 50 400 250"),
                          3000);

// Supply a custom script-based animation effect
var animE = new Animation(elem, function(time) {
    // (Normally we should check for time===null, but in this case it produces
    //  the correct result anyway)
    document.documentElement.currentScale = 1.0 + time * 2.0;
  }, 3000);
</pre>

The third parameter representing the animation's timing, may
simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> in
milliseconds as above, or, to specify further timing properties such
as the <a title="animation node playback rate">playback rate</a>,
an {{AnimationTimingInput}} object can be used as follows:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
var anim =
  new Animation(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3000, playbackRate: 2 });
</pre>

            If the duration is not specified, the <a>intrinsic iteration
            duration</a> is used which, for an <a>animation</a> is zero.
            It is possible to create an animation that simply sets a property
            without any interpolation as follows:

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' }, { fill: 'forwards' });
</pre>

This is particularly useful in combination with other <a
title="animation">animations</a> or <a>animation nodes</a>.
For example, fading an element before switching
&lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
follows,

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
new AnimationSequence(
  [
    new Animation(elem, { opacity: 0 }, 1000),
    new Animation(elem, { display: 'none' }, { fill: 'forwards' })
  ]
);
</pre>

Having created an {{Animation}}, it can be played using
<code>document.timeline.play(<var>anim</var>)</code>.
For simple effects, however, the <a
href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
shortcut is more convenient since it performs this last step
automatically. For example,

<pre class='example sh_javascript'>
elem.animate({ left: '100px' }, 3000);
</pre>

    <code>{ident}</code> here is an <a

        a constant rate.

    :   paced

        Unicode codepoint.

        As a result, changes to the keyframes may cause the <a>paced

        Note: this behavior is generally not useful for
            keyframes specifying more than one property.

<div class="note">

Since accessing the properties of an ECMAScript user object can
have side effects, the manner in which these properties is
accessed is important.
In light of this consideration the procedure for converting an
ECMAScript object into an IDL {{Keyframe}} object has the following
properties:

*   Each property that is read, is read only once.
*   Properties are read in a well-defined order.
*   Properties corresponding to unsupported target properties or
    attributes are not read.

</div>

The <dfn>procedure for converting an ECMAScript value to an IDL
Keyframe object</dfn> with parameter <var>keyframe input</var>
is as follows:

1.  Let <var>keyframe result</var> be a {{Keyframe}} object with the
    <code>offset</code>, <code>easing</code> and
    <code>composite</code> attributes set to the default dictionary
    values.
2.  Create a list, <var>supported properties</var>, of property
    names and attribute names that can be animated by the
    implementation.
3.  Convert each property name in <var>supported properties</var>
    to the equivalent IDL attribute by applying the <a
    href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#css-property-to-idl-attribute">CSS
    property to IDL attribute</a> algorithm [[!CSSOM]].
4.  If the user agent supports animation of the 'float'
    CSS property, replace "float" in
    <var>supported properties</var> with "cssFloat".
5.  Let <var>animation properties</var> be an empty sequence.
6.  Use the internal [&zwnj;[Enumerate]] operation on <var>keyframe
    input</var> to iterate over its properties.
    For each <var>property</var> perform the step corresponding to
    the first matching condition from below, if any.

    <div class="switch">

    :   If <var>property</var> is a case-sensitive match for
        the string "offset",</dt>

        name "offset".

    :   If <var>property</var> is a case-sensitive match for

        the [&zwnj;[Get]] internal method of <var>keyframe
        input</var> with property name "easing".

        If the resulting string does not conform to the
        grammar defined for the {{AnimationTiming/easing}}
        attribute of the {{AnimationTiming}} interface or
        is not supported by the implementation, then
        set the <code>easing</code> of <var>keyframe result</var>
        to the string &ldquo;linear&rdquo;.

    :   If <var>property</var> is a case-sensitive match for

        comparison,</dt>
    ::  append <var>property</var> to <var>animation
        properties</var>.</dd>

    </div>

7.  For user agents that support both a prefixed and an
    unprefixed version of some CSS properties, remove all
    prefixed properties from <var>animation properties</var>
    where the corresponding unprefixed version is also
    present in <var>animation properties</var>.

    Note: I'd like to remove this step. Prefixes are history.

8.  Sort <var>animation properties</var> lexicographically by
    the Unicode codepoints that define each element.
9.  Iterate over <var>animation properties</var> from beginning to
    end and for each <var>name</var> in <var>animation
    properties</var> add a new member pair to <var>keyframe
    result</var> as follows:

    *   <em>member name</em>: the result of applying the
        the <a
        href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#idl-attribute-to-css-property">IDL
        attribute to CSS property</a> algorithm [[!CSSOM]] to
        <var>name</var> unless <var>name</var> is
        a case-sensitive match for the string "cssFloat" in
        which case use the string "float".
    *   <em>member value</em>: the result of calling
        <code>ToString</code> on the value returned from the
        [&zwnj;[Get]] method of <var>keyframe input</var> with property
        name, <var>name</var>.
        If [&zwnj;[Get]] returns null or undefined, let the member
        value be an empty string.

10. Return <var>keyframe result</var>.

<div class="issue">

The above algorithm gives special meaning to the property names
"offset", "computedOffset", "easing", and "composite".
If a CSS property called "offset" or "composite" is ever
introduced it will clash with the meaning here.

We have a few options:

*   Add special handling at that time to allow addressing the
    property of the same name, e.g. <code>cssOffset</code>.
*   Rename these keywords now to reduce risk of a later clash,
    e.g. "keyframeOffset".

Since DOM Elements may be the target of an animation,
the <a class="externalDFN"

interface [[!DOM]] is extended as follows:

<pre class="idl">Element implements Animatable</pre>

This allows the following kind of usage.

<pre class="example sh_javascript">
elem.animate({ color: 'red' }, 2000);

<h3 id="extensions-to-the-pseudoelement-interface">Extensions to the <code>PseudoElement</code> interface</h3>

    of CSSOM</a>.
    If it is removed, we will need to provide an equivalent definition
    here.

<h3 id="script-execution-and-live-updates-to-the-model">Script execution and live updates to the model</h3>

The interaction between script execution and the state and effects of
the Web Animations model is as follows:

*   Changes made to the Web Animations model via the programming
    interface are reflected immediately in the values returned by the
    interfaces defined in this specification.

    Similarly, methods that operate on the current state of the model
    such as pausing or reversing are applied to a fully-updated timing
    model, that is, after all previous modifications have been
    incorporated.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    For example, if the {{AnimationPlayer}}
    associated with an {{Animation}} is seeked (see <a section
    href="#setting-the-current-time-of-a-player"></a>) via the programming
    interface, the value returned when querying the
    animation's <code>startTime</code> will reflect updated state of
    the model immediately.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
      // Initially player.src.localTime is 3000
      player.currentTime += 2000;
      alert(player.src.localTime); // Displays &lsquo;5000&rsquo;
    </pre></div>

    The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
    Web Animations model such as adding and removing children from
    an {{AnimationGroup}}.

    </div>

*   Querying the computed style of a property affected by
    animation, or the value of an attribute affected by animation,
    returns the value based the <em>current state</em> of the
    model, that is, after incorporating any modifications made using
    the programming interface.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    For example, if the used style of an element is queried
    immediately after applying a new <a>Animation</a> to that
    element, the result of the new animation will be
    incorporated in the value returned.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    // Set opacity to 0 immediately
    elem.animate({ opacity: 0 }, { fill: &lsquo;forwards&rsquo; });
    alert(window.getComputedStyle(elem).opacity); // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;
    </pre></div>

    The means of querying the animated value of an attribute depends
    on the interface defined for the attribute.
    SVG 1.1 [[!SVG11]] defines an additional interface for querying
    animated values.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    // Set width to 0 immediately
    rect.animate({ width: &lsquo;100px&rsquo; }, { fill: &lsquo;forwards&rsquo; });
    alert(rect.width.animVal.value); // Displays &lsquo;100&rsquo;
    </pre></div>

    </div>

*   Changes made to the model using the programming interface do
    <em>not</em> cause any {{EffectCallback}} functions to be
    called.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    For example, in the following code, the callback function will
    not be called until <em>after</em> the script block has
    completed during regular sampling.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    var timesCalled = 0;
    elem.animate(function() {
      timesCalled++;
    }, 10000);
    alert(timesCalled); // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;
    </pre></div>

    </div>


*   Changes to specified style, specified attribute values, and the
    state of the Web Animations model made within the same execution
    block must be synchronized when rendering such that the whole set
    of changes is rendered together.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    For example, a user agent must not render only the changes to
    specified style made in a script execution block whilst ignoring
    changes to animations.
    This guarantees that the following usage will never produce
    a situation where <em>only</em> the change to specified style is
    rendered without the animation.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    // Fade the opacity with fallback for browsers that don't
    // support Element.animate
    elem.style.opacity = &lsquo;0&rqsuo;
    elem.animate([ { opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 } ], 500);
    </pre></div>

    Note that a user agent may render a frame with <em>none</em> of
    the changes made in a script execution block.
    This might happen, for example, if rendering occurs in
    a separate process that is scheduled to run shortly after
    a script execution block completes but before changes made via
    script can be communicated to the process.

    </div>

*   The value returned by the <code>currentTime</code> attribute of
    a <a>document timeline</a> will not change within a script block.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    For example, querying the <code>currentTime</code> twice within
    a long block of code that is executed in the same script block
    will return the same value as shown in the following example.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    var a = document.timeline.currentTime;
    // ... many lines of code ...
    var b = document.timeline.currentTime;
    alert(b - a); // Displays 0
    </pre></div>

    </div>

*   User agents that support Timing control for script-based
    animations [[ANIMATION-TIMING]], prior to <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/#dfn-sample-all-animations"
    class="externalDFN">sampling animation frame request

    class="externalDFN">top-level browsing context</a>,
    must perform a <a title='single-sample'>sample</a> including 
    executing any eligible
    <a>custom effects</a> (see <a href="#sampling-custom-effects"
    section></a>) for all <a>animation nodes</a>

    class="externalDFN">active document</a> of the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context"
    class="externalDFN">top-level browsing context</a> or
    of any of its <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#list-of-the-descendant-browsing-contexts"
    class="externalDFN">descendant browsing contexts</a>.
    When performing this <a title='single-sample'>sample</a>, the 
    <a>time value</a> of
    each <a>document timeline</a> must be equal to the <var>time</var>
    passed to animation frame request callbacks for that browsing
    context.

    <div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

    As a result of this definition, the time passed to
    a <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> callback acts as
    an alias for <code>document.timeline.currentTime</code>.

    <div><pre class="example sh_javascript">
    window.requestAnimationFrame(function(sampleTime) {
      // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;
      alert(sampleTime - document.timeline.currentTime);
    });
    </pre></div>

    </div>


<h2 id="integration-with-media-fragments">Integration with Media Fragments</h2>

The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGS]] defines a means
for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
resource on which they are specified.
For resources with the <a class="externalDFN"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
[[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/web-animations/animation-elements.html">
Animation elements</a> specification.

Note: media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
    their MIME type.
    As a result, temporal addressing may not be supported in all situations
    where Web Animations content is used.

<h2 id="interaction-with-page-display">Interaction with page display</h2>

HTML permits user agents to store <a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#an-entry-with-persisted-user-state">user-agent
  defined state</a> along with a
<a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#session-history-entry">session
history entry</a> so that as a user navigates between pages, the
previous state of the page can be restored including state such as
scroll position [[HTML5]].


User agents that pause and resume <a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/embedded-content-0.html#media-element">media
elements</a> when the referencing document is
unloaded and traversed,
are encouraged to apply consistent handling to documents containing Web
Animations content.
If provided, this behavior SHOULD be achieved by adjusting the <a>time
values</a> of any <a>timelines</a> bound to the <a>global clock</a>.

Issue: Is this at odds with those <a>time values</a> being relative to
    <code>navigationStart</code> and with <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>
    using the same time as <code>document.timeline.currentTime</code>?


<h2 id="implementation-requirements">Implementation requirements</h2>

<h3 id="precision-of-time-values">Precision of time values</h3>

The internal representation of time values is implementation dependant
however, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents be able to represent input
time values with microsecond precision so that 0.000001 is
distinguishable from 0.0.

<h3 id="conformance-criteria">Conformance criteria</h3>

This specification defines an abstract model for animation and, as
such, for user agents that do not support scripting, there are no
conformance criteria since there is no testable surface area.

User agents that do not support scripting, however, may implement
additional technologies defined in terms of this specification in
which case the definitions provided in this specification will form
part of the conformance criteria of the additional technology.

A <dfn>conforming scripted Web Animations user agent</dfn> is a user
agent that implements the <abbr

<a href="#programming-interface" section></a>.
